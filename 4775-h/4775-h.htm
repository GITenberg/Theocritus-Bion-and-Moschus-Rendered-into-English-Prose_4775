<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>LIFE
OF THEOCRITUS</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>From Suidas</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theocritus</span>, the Chian.&nbsp; But
there is another Theocritus, the son of Praxagoras and Philinna
(see Epigram XXIII), or as some say of Simichus.&nbsp; (This is
plainly derived from the assumed name Simichidas in Idyl
VII.)&nbsp; He was a Syracusan, or, as others say, a Coan settled
in Syracuse.&nbsp; He wrote the so-called <i>Bucolics</i> in the
Dorian dialect.&nbsp; Some attribute to him the following
works:&mdash;<i>The Proetidae</i>, <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>
(&#7960;&lambda;&pi;&#943;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;),
<i>Hymns</i>, <i>The Heroines</i>, <i>Dirges</i>, <i>Ditties</i>,
<i>Elegies</i>, <i>Iambics</i>, <i>Epigrams</i>.&nbsp; But it
known that there are three Bucolic poets: this Theocritus,
Moschus of Sicily, and Bion of Smyrna, from a village called
Phlossa.</p>

&Theta;&Epsilon;&Omicron;&Kappa;&Rho;&Iota;&Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon;
&Gamma;&Epsilon;&Nu;&Omicron;&Sigma;</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Usually prefixed to the
Idyls</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theocritus</span> the Bucolic poet was a
Syracusan by extraction, and the son of Simichidas, as he says
himself, <i>Simichidas</i>, <i>pray whither through the noon dost
thou dray thy feet</i>? (Idyl VII).&nbsp; Some say that this was
an assumed name, for he seems to have been snub-nosed
(&sigma;&iota;&mu;&#972;&sigmaf;), and that his father was
Praxagoras, and his mother Philinna.&nbsp; He became the pupil of
Philetas and Asclepiades, of whom he speaks (Idyl VII), and
flourished about the time of Ptolemy Lagus.&nbsp; He gained much
fame for his skill in bucolic poetry.&nbsp; According to some his
original name was Moschus, and Theocritus was a name he later
assumed.</p>

xi</span>THEOCRITUS AND HIS AGE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of the third
century before Christ, in the years just preceding those in which
Theocritus wrote, the genius of Greece seemed to have lost her
productive force.&nbsp; Nor would it have been strange if that
force had really been exhausted.&nbsp; Greek poetry had hitherto
enjoyed a peculiarly free development, each form of art
succeeding each without break or pause, because each&mdash;epic,
lyric, dithyramb, the drama&mdash;had responded to some new need
of the state and of religion.&nbsp; Now in the years that
followed the fall of Athens and the conquests of Macedonia, Greek
religion and the Greek state had ceased to be themselves.&nbsp;
Religion and the state had been the patrons of poetry; on their
decline poetry seemed dead.&nbsp; There were no heroic kings,
like those for whom epic minstrels had chanted.&nbsp; The cities
could no longer welcome an Olympian winner with Pindaric
hymns.&nbsp; There was no imperial Athens to fill the theatres
with a crowd of citizens and strangers eager to listen to new <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>tragic
masterpieces.&nbsp; There was no humorous democracy to laugh at
all the world, and at itself, with Aristophanes.&nbsp; The very
religion of Sophocles and Aeschylus was debased.&nbsp; A vulgar
usurper had stripped the golden ornaments from Athene of the
Parthenon.&nbsp; The ancient faith in the protecting gods of
Athens, of Sparta, and of Thebes, had become a lax readiness to
bow down in the temple of any Oriental Rimmon, of Serapis or
Adonis.&nbsp; Greece had turned her face, with Alexander of
Macedon, to the East; Alexander had fallen, and Greece had become
little better than the western portion of a divided Oriental
empire.&nbsp; The centre of intellectual life had been removed
from Athens to Alexandria (<i>founded</i> 332 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>)&nbsp; The new Greek cities of Egypt
and Asia, and above all Alexandria, seemed no cities at all to
Greeks who retained the pure Hellenic traditions.&nbsp;
Alexandria was thirty times larger than the size assigned by
Aristotle to a well-balanced state.&nbsp; Austere spectators saw
in Alexandria an Eastern capital and mart, a place of harems and
bazaars, a home of tyrants, slaves, dreamers, and
pleasure-seekers.&nbsp; Thus a Greek of the old school must have
despaired of Greek poetry.&nbsp; There was nothing (he would have
said) to evoke it; no dawn of liberty could flush this silent
Memnon into song.&nbsp; The collectors, critics, librarians of
Alexandria could only produce literary imitations of the epic and
the hymn, or could at best write epigrams or inscriptions for the
statue of some alien and <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>luxurious god.&nbsp; Their critical
activity in every field of literature was immense, their original
genius sterile.&nbsp; In them the intellect of the Hellenes still
faintly glowed, like embers on an altar that shed no light on the
way.&nbsp; Yet over these embers the god poured once again the
sacred oil, and from the dull mass leaped, like a many-coloured
frame, the genius of <span class="smcap">Theocritus</span>.</p>
<p>To take delight in that genius, so human, so kindly, so
musical in expression, requires, it may be said, no long
preparation.&nbsp; The art of Theocritus scarcely needs to be
illustrated by any description of the conditions among which it
came to perfection.&nbsp; It is always impossible to analyse into
its component parts the genius of a poet.&nbsp; But it is not
impossible to detect some of the influences that worked on
Theocritus.&nbsp; We can study his early
&lsquo;environment&rsquo;; the country scenes he knew, and the
songs of the neatherds which he elevated into art.&nbsp; We can
ascertain the nature of the demand for poetry in the chief cities
and in the literary society of the time.&nbsp; As a result, we
can understand the broad twofold division of the poems of
Theocritus into rural and epic idyls, and with this we must rest
contented.</p>
<p>It is useless to attempt a regular biography of
Theocritus.&nbsp; Facts and dates are alike wanting, the ancient
accounts (p. ix) are clearly based on his works, but it is by no
means impossible to construct a &lsquo;legend&rsquo; or romance
of his life, by aid of his own verses, and of hints and <a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>fragments
which reach us from the past and the present.&nbsp; The genius of
Theocritus was so steeped in the colours of human life, he bore
such true and full witness as to the scenes and men he knew, that
life (always essentially the same) becomes in turn a witness to
his veracity.&nbsp; He was born in the midst of nature that,
through all the changes of things, has never lost its sunny
charm.&nbsp; The existence he loved best to contemplate, that of
southern shepherds, fishermen, rural people, remains what it
always has been in Sicily and in the isles of Greece.&nbsp; The
habits and the passions of his countryfolk have not altered, the
echoes of their old love-songs still sound among the pines, or by
the sea-banks, where Theocritus &lsquo;watched the visionary
flocks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Theocritus was probably born in an early decade of the third
century, or, according to Couat, about 315 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>, and was a native of Syracuse,
&lsquo;the greatest of Greek cities, the fairest of all
cities.&rsquo;&nbsp; So Cicero calls it, describing the four
quarters that were encircled by its walls,&mdash;each quarter as
large as a town,&mdash;the fountain Arethusa, the stately temples
with their doors of ivory and gold.&nbsp; On the fortunate
dwellers in Syracuse, Cicero says, the sun shone every day, and
there was never a morning so tempestuous but the sunlight
conquered at last, and broke through the clouds.&nbsp; That
perennial sunlight still floods the poems of Theocritus with its
joyous glow.&nbsp; His birthplace was the proper home of an
idyllic poet, <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>of one who, with all his enjoyment of the city life of
Greece, had yet been &lsquo;breathed on by the rural Pan,&rsquo;
and best loved the sights and sounds and fragrant air of the
forests and the coast.&nbsp; Thanks to the mountainous regions of
Sicily, to Etna, with her volcanic cliffs and snow-fed streams,
thanks also to the hills of the interior, the populous island
never lost the charm of nature.&nbsp; Sicily was not like the
overcrowded and over-cultivated Attica; among the Sicilian
heights and by the coast were few enclosed estates and narrow
farms.&nbsp; The character of the people, too, was attuned to
poetry.&nbsp; The Dorian settlers had kept alive the magic of
rivers, of pools where the Nereids dance, and uplands haunted by
Pan.&nbsp; This popular poetry influenced the literary verse of
Sicily.&nbsp; The songs of Stesichorus, a minstrel of the early
period, and the little rural &lsquo;mimes&rsquo; or interludes of
Sophron are lost, and we have only fragments of Epicharmus.&nbsp;
But it seems certain that these poets, predecessors of
Theocritus, liked to mingle with their own composition strains of
rustic melody, <i>volks-lieder</i>, ballads, love-songs, ditties,
and dirges, such as are still chanted by the peasants of Greece
and Italy.&nbsp; Thus in Syracuse and the other towns of the
coast, Theocritus would have always before his eyes the spectacle
of refined and luxurious manners, and always in his ears the
babble of the Dorian women, while he had only to pass the gates,
and wander through the fens of Lysimeleia, by the brackish mere,
or <a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>ride
into the hills, to find himself in the golden world of
pastoral.&nbsp; Thinking of his early years, and of the education
that nature gives the poet, we can imagine him, like Callicles in
Mr. Arnold&rsquo;s poem, singing at the banquet of a merchant or
a general&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With his head full of wine, and his hair
crown&rsquo;d,<br />
Touching his harp as the whim came on him,<br />
And praised and spoil&rsquo;d by master and by guests,<br />
Almost as much as the new dancing girl.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can recover the world that met his eyes and inspired his
poems, though the dates of the composition of these poems are
unknown.&nbsp; We can follow him, in fancy, as he breaks from the
revellers and wanders out into the night.&nbsp; Wherever he
turned his feet, he could find such scenes as he has painted in
the idyls.&nbsp; If the moon rode high in heaven, as he passed
through the outlying gardens he might catch a glimpse of some
deserted girl shredding the magical herbs into the burning
brazier, and sending upward to the &lsquo;lady Selene&rsquo; the
song which was to charm her lover home.&nbsp; The magical image
melted in the burning, the herbs smouldered, the tale of love was
told, and slowly the singer &lsquo;drew the quiet night into her
blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her lay ended with a passage of softened
melancholy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Do thou farewell, and turn thy steeds to
Ocean, lady, and my pain I will endure, even as I have
declared.&nbsp; Farewell, Selene beautiful; <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>farewell,
ye other stars that follow the wheels of Night.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A grammarian says that Theocritus borrowed this second idyl,
the story of Simaetha, from a piece by Sophron.&nbsp; But he had
no need to borrow from anything but the nature before his
eyes.&nbsp; Ideas change so little among the Greek country
people, and the hold of superstition is so strong, that betrayed
girls even now sing to the Moon their prayer for pity and
help.&nbsp; Theocritus himself could have added little passion to
this incantation, still chanted in the moonlit nights of Greece:
<a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Bright golden Moon, that now art near to
thy setting, go thou and salute my lover, he that stole my love,
and that kissed me, and said, &ldquo;Never will I leave
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, lo, he has left me, like a field reaped
and gleaned, like a church where no man comes to pray, like a
city desolate.&nbsp; Therefore I would curse him, and yet again
my heart fails me for tenderness, my heart is vexed within me, my
spirit is moved with anguish.&nbsp; Nay, even so I will lay my
curse on him, and let God do even as He will, with my pain and
with my crying, with my flame, and mine imprecations.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is thus that the women of the islands, like the girl of
Syracuse two thousand years ago, hope to lure back love or
avenged love betrayed, and thus they &lsquo;win more ease from
song than could be bought with gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>In whatever direction the path of the Syracusan
wanderer lay, he would find then, as he would find now in Sicily,
some scene of the idyllic life, framed between the distant Etna
and the sea.&nbsp; If he strayed in the faint blue of the summer
dawn, through the fens to the shore, he might reach the wattled
cabin of the two old fishermen in the twenty-first idyl.&nbsp;
There is nothing in Wordsworth more real, more full of the
incommunicable sense of nature, rounding and softening the
toilsome days of the aged and the poor, than the Theocritean poem
of the Fisherman&rsquo;s Dream.&nbsp; It is as true to nature as
the statue of the naked fisherman in the Vatican.&nbsp; One
cannot read these verses but the vision returns to one, of
sandhills by the sea, of a low cabin roofed with grass, where
fishing-rods of reed are leaning against the door, while the
Mediterranean floats up her waves that fill the waste with
sound.&nbsp; This nature, grey and still, seems in harmony with
the wise content of old men whose days are waning on the limit of
life, as they have all been spent by the desolate margin of the
sea.</p>
<p>The twenty-first idyl is one of the rare poems of Theocritus
that are not filled with the sunlight of Sicily, or of
Egypt.&nbsp; The landscapes he prefers are often seen under the
noonday heat, when shade is most pleasant to men.&nbsp; His
shepherds invite each other to the shelter of oak-trees or of
pines, where the dry fir-needles are strown, or where the
feathered ferns make a luxurious &lsquo;couch more soft than
sleep,&rsquo; <a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>or where the flowers bloom whose musical names sing in
the idyls.&nbsp; Again, Theocritus will sketch the bare
beginnings of the hillside, as in the third idyl, just where the
olive-gardens cease, and where the short grass of the heights
alternates with rocks, and thorns, and aromatic plants.&nbsp;
None of his pictures seem complete without the presence of
water.&nbsp; It may be but the wells that the maidenhair fringes,
or the babbling runnel of the fountain of the Nereids.&nbsp; The
shepherds may sing of Crathon, or Sybaris, or Himeras, waters so
sweet that they seem to flow with milk and honey.&nbsp; Again,
Theocritus may encounter his rustics fluting in rivalry, like
Daphnis and Menalcas in the eighth idyl, &lsquo;on the long
ranges of the hills.&rsquo;&nbsp; Their kine and sheep have fed
upwards from the lower valleys to the place where</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The track winds down to the clear
stream,<br />
To cross the sparkling shallows; there<br />
The cattle love to gather, on their way<br />
To the high mountain pastures and to stay,<br />
Till the rough cow-herds drive them past,<br />
Knee-deep in the cool ford; for &rsquo;tis the last<br />
Of all the woody, high, well-water&rsquo;d dells<br />
On Etna, . . .<br />
. . . glade,<br />
And stream, and sward, and chestnut-trees,<br />
End here; Etna beyond, in the broad glare<br />
Of the hot noon, without a shade,<br />
Slope behind slope, up to the peak, lies bare;<br />
The peak, round which the white clouds play.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theocritus never drives his flock so high, <a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>and rarely
muses on such thoughts as come to wanderers beyond the shade of
trees and the sound of water among the scorched rocks and the
barren lava.&nbsp; The day is always cooled and soothed, in his
idyls, with the &lsquo;music of water that falleth from the high
face of the rock,&rsquo; or with the murmurs of the sea.&nbsp;
From the cliffs and their seat among the bright red berries on
the arbutus shrubs, his shepherds flute to each other, as they
watch the tunny fishers cruising far below, while the echo floats
upwards of the sailors&rsquo; song.&nbsp; These shepherds have
some touch in them of the satyr nature; we might fancy that their
ears are pointed like those of Hawthorne&rsquo;s Donatello, in
&lsquo;Transformation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should be noticed, as a proof of the truthfulness of
Theocritus, that the songs of his shepherds and goatherds are all
such as he might really have heard on the shores of Sicily.&nbsp;
This is the real answer to the criticism which calls him
affected.&nbsp; When mock pastorals flourished at the court of
France, when the long dispute as to the merits of the ancients
and moderns was raging, critics vowed that the hinds of
Theocritus were too sentimental and polite in their
wooings.&nbsp; Refinement and sentiment were to be reserved for
princely shepherds dancing, crook in hand, in the court
ballets.&nbsp; Louis XIV sang of himself&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>A son labeur il passe tout d&rsquo;un
coup</i>,<br />
<i>Et n&rsquo;ira pas dormir sur la fougere</i>,<br />
<a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span><i>Ny
s&rsquo;oublier aupres d&rsquo;une Bergere</i>,<br />
<i>Jusques au point d&rsquo;en oublier le Loup</i>.&rsquo; <a
name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accustomed to royal goatherds in silk and lace, Fontenelle (a
severe critic of Theocritus) could not believe in the delicacy of
a Sicilian who wore a skin &lsquo;stripped from the roughest of
he-goats, with the smell of the rennet clinging to it
still.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus Fontenelle cries, &lsquo;Can any one
suppose that there ever was a shepherd who could say &ldquo;Would
I were the humming bee, Amaryllis, to flit to thy cave, and dip
beneath the branches, and the ivy leaves that hide
thee&rdquo;?&rsquo; and then he quotes other graceful passages
from the love-verses of Theocritean swains.&nbsp; Certainly no
such fancies were to be expected from the French peasants of
Fontenelle&rsquo;s age, &lsquo;creatures blackened with the sun,
and bowed with labour and hunger.&rsquo;&nbsp; The imaginative
grace of Battus is quite as remote from our own hinds.&nbsp; But
we have the best reason to suppose that the peasants of
Theocritus&rsquo;s time expressed refined sentiment in language
adorned with colour and music, because the modern love-songs of
Greek shepherds sound like memories of Theocritus.&nbsp; The
lover of Amaryllis might have sung this among his
ditties&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&Chi;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&delta;&omicron;&nu;&#940;&kappa;&iota;

kiss thee once, to kiss thee twice, and then go flying
homeward.&rsquo; <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his despair, when Love &lsquo;clung to him like a leech of
the fen,&rsquo; he might have murmured&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;&Eta;&theta;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;

<p>&lsquo;Would that I were on the high hills, and lay where lie
the stags, and no more was troubled with the thought of
thee.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, again, is a love-complaint from modern Epirus, exactly
in the tone of Battus&rsquo;s song in the tenth idyl&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;White thou art not, thou art not golden
haired,<br />
Thou art brown, and gracious, and meet for love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a longer love-ditty&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I will begin by telling thee first of thy
perfections: thy body is as fair as an angel&rsquo;s; no painter
could design it.&nbsp; And if any man be sad, he has but to look
on thee, and despite himself he takes courage, the hapless one,
and his heart is joyous.&nbsp; Upon thy brows are shining the
constellated Pleiades, thy breast is full of the flowers of May,
thy breasts are lilies.&nbsp; Thou hast the eyes of a princess,
the glance of a queen, and but one fault hast thou, that thou
deignest not to speak to me.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>Battus might have cried thus, with a modern Greek
singer, to the shade of the dead Amaryllis (Idyl IV), the
&lsquo;gracious Amaryllis, unforgotten even in
death&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ah, light of mine eyes, what gift shall I
send thee; what gift to the other world?&nbsp; The apple rots,
and the quince decayeth, and one by one they perish, the petals
of the rose!&nbsp; I send thee my tears bound in a napkin, and
what though the napkin burns, if my tears reach thee at
last!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty is to stop choosing, where all the verses of
the modern Greek peasants are so rich in Theocritean memories, so
ardent, so delicate, so full of flowers and birds and the music
of fountains.&nbsp; Enough has been said, perhaps, to show what
the popular poetry of Sicily could lend to the genius of
Theocritus.</p>
<p>From her shepherds he borrowed much,&mdash;their bucolic
melody; their love-complaints; their rural superstitions; their
system of answering couplets, in which each singer refines on the
utterance of his rival.&nbsp; But he did not borrow their
&lsquo;pastoral melancholy.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is little of
melancholy in Theocritus.&nbsp; When Battus is chilled by the
thought of the death of Amaryllis, it is but as one is chilled
when a thin cloud passes over the sun, on a bright day of early
spring.&nbsp; And in an epigram the dead girl is spoken of as the
kid that the wolf has seized, while the hounds bay all too
late.&nbsp; Grief will not bring her back.&nbsp; The world <a
name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>must go
its way, and we need not darken its sunlight by long
regret.&nbsp; Yet when, for once, Theocritus adopted the accent
of pastoral lament, when he raised the rural dirge for Daphnis
into the realm of art, he composed a masterpiece, and a model for
all later poets, as for the authors of <i>Lycidas</i>,
<i>Thyrsis</i>, and <i>Adonais</i>.</p>
<p>Theocritus did more than borrow a note from the country
people.&nbsp; He brought the gifts of his own spirit to the
contemplation of the world.&nbsp; He had the clearest vision, and
he had the most ardent love of poetry, &lsquo;of song may all my
dwelling be full, for neither is sleep more sweet, nor sudden
spring, nor are flowers more delicious to the bees, so dear to me
are the Muses.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;Never may we be
sundered, the Muses of Pieria and I.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, he had
perhaps in greater measure than any other poet the gift of the
undisturbed enjoyment of life.&nbsp; The undertone of all his
idyls is joy in the sunshine and in existence.&nbsp; His
favourite word, the word that opens the first idyl, and, as it
were, strikes the keynote, is &alpha;&delta;&#973;,
<i>sweet</i>.&nbsp; He finds all things delectable in the rural
life:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sweet are the voices of the calves, and
sweet the heifers&rsquo; lowing; sweet plays the shepherd on the
shepherd&rsquo;s pipe, and sweet is the echo.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in courtly poems, and in the artificial hymns of which we
are to speak in their place, the memory of the joyful country
life comes over him.&nbsp; He praises Hiero, because Hiero is <a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>to restore
peace to Syracuse, and when peace returns, then &lsquo;thousands
of sheep fattened in the meadows will bleat along the plain, and
the kine, as they flock in crowds to the stalls, will make the
belated traveller hasten on his way.&rsquo;&nbsp; The words evoke
a memory of a narrow country lane in the summer evening, when
light is dying out of the sky, and the fragrance of wild roses by
the roadside is mingled with the perfumed breath of cattle that
hurry past on their homeward road.&nbsp; There was scarcely a
form of the life he saw that did not seem to him worthy of song,
though it might be but the gossip of two rude hinds, or the
drinking bout of the Thessalian horse-jobber, and the false girl
Cynisca and her wild lover &AElig;schines.&nbsp; But it is the
sweet country that he loves best to behold and to remember.&nbsp;
In his youth Sicily and Syracuse were disturbed by civil and
foreign wars, wars of citizens against citizens, of Greeks
against Carthaginians, and against the fierce &lsquo;men of
Mars,&rsquo; the banded mercenaries who possessed themselves of
Messana.&nbsp; But this was not matter for his joyous
Muse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&kappa;&epsilon;&#943;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;

<p>&lsquo;Not of wars, not of tears, but of Pan would he chant,
and of the neatherds he sweetly sang, and singing he shepherded
his flocks.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the training that Sicily, her hills, her seas, her
lovers, her poet-shepherds, gave <a name="pagexxvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>to Theocritus.&nbsp; Sicily showed
him subjects which he imitated in truthful art.&nbsp; Unluckily
the later pastoral poets of northern lands have imitated
<i>him</i>, and so have gone far astray from northern
nature.&nbsp; The pupil of nature had still to be taught the
&lsquo;rules&rsquo; of the critics, to watch the temper and
fashion of his time, and to try his fortune among the courtly
poets and grammarians of the capital of civilisation.&nbsp;
Between the years of early youth in Sicily and the years of
waiting for court patronage at Alexandria, it seems probable that
we must place a period of education in the island of Cos.&nbsp;
The testimonies of the Grammarians who handed on to us the scanty
traditions about Theocritus, agree in making him the pupil of
Philetas of Cos.&nbsp; This Philetas was a critic, a commentator
on Homer, and an elegiac poet whose love-songs were greatly
admired by the Romans of the Augustan age.&nbsp; He is said to
have been the tutor of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who was himself
born, as Theocritus records, in the isle of Cos.&nbsp; It has
been conjectured that Ptolemy and Theocritus were fellow pupils,
and that the poet may have hoped to obtain court favour at
Alexandria from this early connection.&nbsp; About this point
nothing is certainly known, nor can we exactly understand the
sort of education that was given in the school of the poet
Philetas.&nbsp; The ideas of that artificial age make it not
improbable that Philetas professed to teach the art of
poetry.&nbsp; A French critic and poet of our own time, M.
Baudelaire, was willing <a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>to do as much &lsquo;in thirty
lessons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Possibly Philetas may have imparted
technical rules then in vogue, and the fashionable knack of
introducing obscure mythological allusions.&nbsp; He was a
logician as well as a poet, and is fabled to have died of
vexation because he could not unriddle one of the metaphysical
catches or puzzles of the sophists.&nbsp; His varied activity
seems to have worn him to a shadow; the contemporary satirists
bantered him about his leanness, and it was alleged that he wore
leaden soles to his sandals lest the wind should blow him, as it
blew the calves of Daphnis (Idyl IX) over a cliff against the
rocks, or into the sea. <a name="citation0e"></a><a
href="#footnote0e" class="citation">[0e]</a>&nbsp; Philetas seems
a strange master for Theocritus, but, whatever the qualities of
the teacher, Cos, the home of the luxurious old age of Meleager,
was a beautiful school.&nbsp; The island was one of the most
ancient colonies of the Dorians, and the Syracusan scholar found
himself among a people who spoke his own broad and liquid
dialect.&nbsp; The sides of the limestone hills were clothed with
vines, and with shadowy plane-trees which still attain
extraordinary size and age, while the wine-presses where Demeter
smiled, &lsquo;with sheaves and poppies in her hands,&rsquo;
yielded a famous vintage.&nbsp; The people had a soft industry of
their own, they fashioned the &lsquo;Coan stuff,&rsquo;
transparent robes for woman&rsquo;s wear, like the
&#973;&delta;&#940;&tau;&iota;&nu;&alpha;
&beta;&rho;&#940;&kappa;&eta;, the thin undulating tissues which
Theugenis was to weave <a name="pagexxviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>with the ivory distaff, the gift
of Theocritus.&nbsp; As a colony of Epidaurus, Cos naturally
cultivated the worship of Asclepius, the divine physician, the
child of Apollo.&nbsp; In connection with his worship and with
the clan of the Asclepiadae (that widespread stock to which
Aristotle belonged, and in which the practice of leechcraft was
hereditary), Cos possessed a school of medicine.&nbsp; In the
temple of Asclepius patients hung up as votive offerings
representations of their diseased limbs, and thus the temple
became a museum of anatomical specimens.&nbsp; Cos was therefore
resorted to by young students from all parts of the East, and
Theocritus cannot but have made many friends of his own
age.&nbsp; Among these he alludes in various passages to Nicias,
afterwards a physician at Miletus, to Philinus, noted in later
life as the head of a medical sect, and to Aratus.&nbsp;
Theocritus has sung of Aratus&rsquo;s love-affairs, and St. Paul
has quoted him as a witness to man&rsquo;s instinctive consent in
the doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God.&nbsp; These
strangely various notices have done more for the memory of Aratus
than his own didactic poem on the meteorological theories of his
age.&nbsp; He lives, with Philinus and the rest of the Coan
students, because Theocritus introduced them into the picture of
a happy summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; In the seventh idyl, that one

<p>when he &lsquo;had not yet reached the mid-point of the way,
nor had the tomb yet risen on his sight.&rsquo;&nbsp; He reveals
himself as he was at the height of morning, at the best moment of
the journey, in midsummer of a genius still unchecked by doubt,
or disappointment, or neglect.&nbsp; Life seems to accost him
with the glance of the goatherd Lycidas, &lsquo;and still he
smiled as he spoke, with laughing eyes, and laughter dwelling on
his lips.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Cos, Theocritus found friendship, and
met Myrto, &lsquo;the girl he loved as dearly as goats love the
spring.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he could express, without any
afterthought, an enthusiastic adoration for the disinterested
joys, the enchanted moments of human existence.&nbsp; Before he
entered the thronged streets of Alexandria, and tuned his
shepherd&rsquo;s pipe to catch the ear of princes, and to sing
the epithalamium of a royal and incestuous love, he rested with
his friends in the happy island.&nbsp; Deep in a cave, among the
ruins of ancient aqueducts, there still bubbles up, from the Coan
limestone, the well-spring of the Nymphs.&nbsp; &lsquo;There they
reclined on beds of fragrant rushes, lowly strown, and rejoicing
they lay in new stript leaves of the vine.&nbsp; And high above
their heads waved many a poplar, many an elm-tree, while close at
hand the sacred water from the nymph&rsquo;s own cave welled
forth with murmurs musical&rsquo; (Idyl VII).</p>
<p><a name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>The
old Dorian settlers in Syracuse pleased themselves with the fable
that their fountain, Arethusa, had been a Grecian nymph, who,
like themselves, had crossed the sea to Sicily.&nbsp; The poetry
of Theocritus, read or sung in sultry Alexandria, must have
seemed like a new welling up of the waters of Arethusa in the
sandy soil of Egypt.&nbsp; We cannot certainly say when the poet
first came from Syracuse, or from Cos, to Alexandria.&nbsp; It is
evident however from the allusions in the fifteenth and
seventeenth idyls that he was living there after Ptolemy
Philadelphus married his own sister, Arsino&euml;.&nbsp; It is
not impossible to form some idea of the condition of Alexandrian
society, art, religion, literature and learning at the court of
Ptolemy Philadelphus.&nbsp; The vast city, founded some sixty
years before, was now completed.&nbsp; The walls, many miles in
circuit, protected a population of about eight hundred thousand
souls.&nbsp; Into that changing crowd were gathered adventurers
from all the known world.&nbsp; Merchantmen brought to Ptolemy
the wares of India and the porcelains of China.&nbsp; Marauders
from upper Egypt skulked about the native quarters, and sallied
forth at night to rob the wayfarer.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s guards
were recruited with soldiers from turbulent Greece, from Asia,
from Italy.&nbsp; Settlers were attracted from Syracuse by the
prospect of high wages and profitable labour.&nbsp; The Jewish
quarters were full of Israelites who did not disdain Greek
learning.&nbsp; The city in which this multitude found a home <a
name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>was
beautifully constructed.&nbsp; The Mediterranean filled the
northern haven, the southern walls were washed by the Mareotic
lake.&nbsp; If the isle of Pharos shone dazzling white, and
wearied the eyes, there was shade beneath the long marble
colonnades, and in the groves and cool halls of the Museum and
the Libraries.&nbsp; The Etesian winds blew fresh in summer from
the north, across the sea, and refreshed the people in their
gardens.&nbsp; No town seemed greater nor wealthier to the
voyager, who (like the hero of the Greek novel <i>Clitophon and
Leucippe</i>) entered by the gate of the Sun, and found that,
after nightfall, the torches borne by men and women hastening to
some religious feast, filled the dusk with a light like that of
&lsquo;the sun cut up into fragments.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the same
time no town was more in need of the memories of the country,
which came to her in well-watered gardens, in
landscape-paintings, and in the verse of Theocritus.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give a clearer idea of the opulence and
luxury of Alexandria and her kings, than will be conveyed by the
description of the coronation-feast of Ptolemy
Philadelphus.&nbsp; This great masquerade and banquet was
prepared by the elder Ptolemy on the occasion of his admitting
his son to share his throne.&nbsp; The entertainment was
described (in a work now lost) by Callixenus of Rhodes, and the
record has been preserved by Atheneaus (v. 25).&nbsp; The inner
pavilion in which the guests of Ptolemy reclined, contained one
hundred and thirty-five <a name="pagexxxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>couches.&nbsp; Over the roof was
placed a scarlet awning, with a fringe of white, and there were
many other awnings, richly embroidered with mythological
designs.&nbsp; The pillars which sustained the roof were shaped
in the likeness of palm-trees, and of <i>thyrsi</i>, the weapons
of the wine-god Dionysus.&nbsp; Round three outer sides ran
arcades, draped with purple tissues, and with the skins of
strange beasts.&nbsp; The fourth side, open to the air, was shady
with the foliage of myrtles and laurels.&nbsp; Everywhere the
ground was carpeted with flowers, though the season was
mid-winter, with roses and white lilies and blossoms of the
gardens.&nbsp; By the columns round the whole pavilion were
arrayed a hundred effigies in marble, executed by the most famous
sculptors, and on the middle spaces were hung works by the
painters of Sicyon and tapestry woven with stories of the
adventures of the gods.&nbsp; Above these, again, ran a frieze of
gold and silver shields, while in the higher niches were placed
comic, tragic, and satiric sculptured groups &lsquo;dressed in
real clothes,&rsquo; says the historian, much admiring this
realism.&nbsp; It is impossible to number the tripods, and
flagons, and couches of gold, resting on golden figures of
sphinxes, the salvers, the bowls, the jewelled vases.&nbsp; The
masquerade of this winter festival began with the procession of
the Morning-star, Heosphoros, and then followed a masque of kings
and a revel of various gods, while the company of Hesperus, the
Evening-star followed, and ended all.&nbsp; The <a
name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxiii</span>revel
of Dionysus was introduced by men disguised as Sileni, wild
woodland beings in raiment of purple and scarlet.&nbsp; Then came
scores of satyrs with gilded lamps in their hands.&nbsp; Next
appeared beautiful maidens, attired as Victories, waving golden
wings and swinging vessels of burning incense.&nbsp; The altar of
the God of the Vine was borne behind them, crowned and covered
with leaves of gold, and next boys in purple robes scattered
fragrant scents from golden salvers.&nbsp; Then came a throng of
gold-crowned satyrs, their naked bodies stained with purple and
vermilion, and among them was a tall man who represented the year
and carried a horn of plenty.&nbsp; He was followed by a
beautiful woman in rich attire, carrying in one hand branches of
the palm-tree, in the other a rod of the peach-tree, starred with
its constellated flowers.&nbsp; Then the masque of the Seasons
swept by, and Philiscus followed, Philiscus the Corcyraean, the
priest of Dionysus, and the favourite tragic poet of the
court.&nbsp; After the prizes for the athletes had been borne
past, Dionysus himself was charioted along, a gigantic figure
clad in purple, and pouring libations out of a golden
goblet.&nbsp; Around him lay huge drinking-cups, and smoking
censers of gold, and a bower of vine leaves grew up, and shaded
the head of the god.&nbsp; Then hurried by a crowd of priests and
priestesses, Maenads, Bacchantes, Bassarids, women crowned with
the vine, or with garlands of snakes, and girls bearing the
mystic <a name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiv</span><i>vannus Iacchi</i>.&nbsp; And still the procession
was not ended.&nbsp; A mechanical figure of Nysa passed, in a
chariot drawn by eighty men, among clusters of grapes formed of
precious stones, and the figure arose, and poured milk out of a
golden horn.&nbsp; The Satyrs and Sileni followed close, and
behind them six hundred men dragged on a wain, a silver vessel
that held six hundred measures of wine.&nbsp; This was only the
first of countless symbolic vessels that were carried past, till
last came a multitude of sixteen hundred boys clad in white
tunics, and garlanded with ivy, who bore and handed to the guests
golden and silver vessels full of sweet wine.&nbsp; All this was
only part of one procession, and the festival ended when Ptolemy
and Berenice and Ptolemy Philadelphus had been crowned with
golden crowns from many subject cities and lands.</p>
<p>This festival was obviously arranged to please the taste of a
prince with late Greek ideas of pictorial display, and with
barbaric wealth at his command.&nbsp; Theocritus himself enables
us in the seventeenth idyl to estimate the opulence and the
dominion of Ptolemy.&nbsp; He was not master of fertile Aegypt
alone, where the Nile breaks the rich dank soil, and where myriad
cities pour their taxes into his treasuries.&nbsp; Ptolemy held
lands also in Phoenicia, and Arabia; he claimed Syria and Libya
and Aethiopia; he was lord of the distant Pamphylians, of the
Cilicians, the Lycians and the Carians, and the Cyclades owned
his mastery.&nbsp; <a name="pagexxxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxv</span>Thus the wealth of the richest part
of the world flowed into Alexandria, attracting thither the
priests of strange religions, the possessors of Greek learning,
the painters and sculptors whose work has left its traces on the
genius of Theocritus.</p>
<p>Looking at this early Alexandrian age, three points become
clear to us.&nbsp; First, the fashion of the times was Oriental,
Oriental in religion and in society.&nbsp; Nothing could be less
Hellenic, than the popular cult of Adonis.&nbsp; The fifteenth
idyl of Theocritus shows us Greek women worshipping in their
manner at an Assyrian shrine, the shrine of that effeminate lover
of Aphrodite, whom Heracles, according to the Greek proverb,
thought &lsquo;no great divinity.&rsquo;&nbsp; The hymn of Bion,
with its luxurious lament, was probably meant to be chanted at
just such a festival as Theocritus describes, while a crowd of
foreigners gossiped among the flowers and embroideries, the
strangely-shaped sacred cakes, the ebony, the gold, and the
ivory.&nbsp; Not so much Oriental as barbarous was the impulse
which made Ptolemy Philadelphus choose his own sister,
Arsino&euml;, for wife, as if absolute dominion had already
filled the mind of the Macedonian royal race with the incestuous
pride of the Incas, or of Queen Hatasu, in an elder Egyptian
dynasty.&nbsp; This nascent barbarism has touched a few of the
Alexandrian poems even of Theocritus, and his panegyric of
Ptolemy, of his divine ancestors, and his sister-bride is not
much more Greek in sentiment than are those old native hymns of
<a name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvi</span>Pentaur to &lsquo;the strong Bull,&rsquo; or the
&lsquo;Risen Sun,&rsquo; to Rameses or Thothmes.</p>
<p>Again, the early Alexandrian was what we call a
&lsquo;literary&rsquo; age.&nbsp; Literature was not an affair of
religion and of the state, but ministered to the pleasure of
individuals, and at their pleasure was composed. <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a>&nbsp; The temper of the time was
crudely critical.&nbsp; The Museum and the Libraries, with their
hundreds of thousands of volumes, were hot-houses of grammarians
and of learned poets.&nbsp; Callimachus, the head librarian, was
also the most eminent man of letters.&nbsp; Unable, himself, to
compose a poem of epic length and copiousness, he discouraged all
long poems.&nbsp; He shone in epigrams, pedantic hymns, and
didactic verses.&nbsp; He toyed with anagrams, and won court
favour by discovering that the letters of
&lsquo;Arsino&euml;,&rsquo; the name of Ptolemy&rsquo;s wife,
made the words &#943;&omicron;&nu; &Eta;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;, the
violet of Hera.&nbsp; In another masterpiece the genius of
Callimachus followed the stolen tress of Queen Berenice to the
skies, where the locks became a constellation.&nbsp; A
contemporary of Callimachus was Zenodotus, the critic, who was
for improving the Iliad and Odyssey by cutting out all the epic
commonplaces which seemed to him to be needless
repetitions.&nbsp; It is pretty plain that, in literary society,
Homer was thought out of date and <i>rococo</i>.&nbsp; The
favourite topics of poets were now, not the tales of Troy and
Thebes, but the amorous adventures of the gods.&nbsp; When
Apollonius Rhodius attempted to <a name="pagexxxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxvii</span>revive the epic, it is said that
the influence of Callimachus quite discomfited the young
poet.&nbsp; A war of epigrams began, and while Apollonius called
Callimachus a &lsquo;blockhead&rsquo; (so finished was his
invective), the veteran compared his rival to the Ibis, the
scavenger-bird.&nbsp; Other singers satirised each others&rsquo;
legs, and one, the Aretino of the time, mocked at king Ptolemy
and scourged his failings in verse.&nbsp; The literary quarrels
(to which Theocritus seems to allude in Idyl VII, where Lycidas
says he &lsquo;hates the birds of the Muses that cackle in vain
rivalry with Homer&rsquo;) were as stupid as such affairs usually
are.&nbsp; The taste for artificial epic was to return; although
many people already declared that Homer was the world&rsquo;s
poet, and that the world needed no other.&nbsp; This epic
reaction brought into favour Apollonius Rhodius, author of the
<i>Argonautica</i>.&nbsp; Theocritus has been supposed to aim at
him as a vain rival of Homer, but M. Couat points out that
Theocritus was seventy when Apollonius began to write.&nbsp; The
literary fashions of Alexandria are only of moment to us so far
as they directly affected Theocritus.&nbsp; They could not make
him obscure, affected, tedious, but his nature probably inclined
him to obey fashion so far as only to write short poems.&nbsp;
His rural poems are
&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&#973;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;,
&lsquo;little pictures.&rsquo;&nbsp; His fragments of epic, or
imitations of the epic hymns are not</p>
<blockquote><p>&#972;&sigma;&alpha;
&pi;&#972;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#940;&epsilon;&#943;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;not full and sonorous as the songs of Homer <a
name="pagexxxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxviii</span>and
the sea.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ce po&egrave;te est le moins na&iuml;f qui
se puisse rencontrer, et il se d&eacute;gage de son oeuvre un
parfum de na&iuml;vet&eacute; rustique.&rsquo; <a
name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g"
class="citation">[0g]</a>&nbsp; They are, what a German critic
has called them, <i>mythologischen genre-bilder</i>, cabinet
pictures in the manner called <i>genre</i>, full of pretty detail
and domestic feeling.&nbsp; And this brings us to the third
characteristic of the age,&mdash;its art was elaborately
pictorial.&nbsp; Poetry seems to have sought inspiration from
painting, while painting, as we have said, inclined to
<i>genre</i>, to luxurious representations of the amours of the
gods or the adventures of heroes, with backgrounds of pastoral
landscape.&nbsp; Shepherds fluted while Perseus slew Medusa.</p>
<p>The old order of things in Greece had been precisely the
opposite of this Alexandrian manner.&nbsp; Homer and the later
Homeric legends, with the tragedians, inspired the sculptors, and
even the artisans who decorated vases.&nbsp; When a new order of
subjects became fashionable, and when every rich Alexandrian had
pictures or frescoes on his walls, it appears that the painters
took the lead, that the initiative in art was theirs.&nbsp; The
Alexandrian pictures perished long ago, but the relics of
Alexandrian style which remain in the buried cities of Campania,
in Pompeii especially, bear testimony to the taste of the period.
<a name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a>&nbsp; Out of nearly two thousand
Pompeian pictures, it is <a name="pagexxxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxix</span>calculated that some fourteen
hundred (roughly speaking) are mythological in subject.&nbsp; The
loves of the gods are repeated in scores of designs, and these
designs closely correspond to the mythological poems of
Theocritus and his younger contemporaries Bion and Moschus.&nbsp;
Take as an example the adventure of Europa: Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s
lines, in <i>The Palace of Art</i> are intended to describe
<i>picture</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or sweet Europa&rsquo;s mantle blew
unclasp&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From off her shoulder backward borne:<br />
From one hand droop&rsquo;d a crocus: one hand grasp&rsquo;d<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mild bull&rsquo;s golden
horn.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words of Moschus also seem as if they might have derived
their inspiration from a painting, the touches are so minute, and
so picturesque&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Meanwhile Europa, riding on the back of the
divine bull, with one hand clasped the beast&rsquo;s great horn,
and with the other caught up her garment&rsquo;s purple fold,
lest it might trail and be drenched in the hoar sea&rsquo;s
infinite spray.&nbsp; And her deep robe was blown out in the
wind, like the sail of a ship, and lightly ever it wafted the
maiden onward.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now every single &lsquo;motive&rsquo; of this
description,&mdash;Europa with one hand holding the bull&rsquo;s
horn, with the other lifting her dress, the wind puffing out her
shawl like a sail, is repeated in the Pompeian wall-pictures,
which themselves are believed to be derived from Alexandrian
originals.&nbsp; There are more curious coincidences <a
name="pagexl"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xl</span>than
this.&nbsp; In the sixth idyl of Theocritus, Damoetas makes the
Cyclops say that Galatea &lsquo;will send him many a
messenger.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mere idea of describing the monstrous
cannibal Polyphemus in love, is artificial and Alexandrian.&nbsp;
But who were the &lsquo;messengers&rsquo; of the sea-nymph
Galatea?&nbsp; A Pompeian picture illustrates the point, by
representing a little Love riding up to the shore on the back of
a dolphin, with a letter in his hand for Polyphemus.&nbsp; Greek
art in Egypt suffered from an Egyptian plague of Loves.&nbsp;
Loves flutter through the Pompeian pictures as they do through
the poems of Moschus and Bion.&nbsp; They are carried about in
cages, for sale, like birds.&nbsp; They are caught in
bird-traps.&nbsp; They don the lion-skin of Heracles.&nbsp; They
flutter about baskets laden with roses; round rosy Loves, like
the cupids of Boucher.&nbsp; They are not akin to &lsquo;the
grievous Love,&rsquo; the mighty wrestler who threw Daphnis a
fall, in the first idyl of Theocritus.&nbsp; They are &lsquo;the
children that flit overhead, the little Loves, like the young
nightingales upon the budding trees,&rsquo; which flit round the
dead Adonis in the fifteenth idyl.&nbsp; They are the birds that
shun the boy fowler, in Bion&rsquo;s poem, and perch uncalled (as
in a bronze in the Uffizi) on the grown man.&nbsp; In one or
other of the sixteen Pompeian pictures of Venus and Adonis, the
Loves are breaking their bows and arrows for grief, as in the
hymn of Bion.</p>
<p>Enough has perhaps been said about the social and artistic
taste of Alexandria to account <a name="pagexli"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xli</span>for the remarkable differences in
manner between the rustic idyls of Theocritus and the epic idyls
of himself and his followers Moschus and Bion.&nbsp; In the rural
idyls, Theocritus was himself and wrote to please himself.&nbsp;
In the epic idyls, as in the Hymn to the Dioscuri, and in the two
poems on Heracles, he was writing to please the taste of
Alexandria.&nbsp; He had to choose epic topics, but he was warned
by the famous saying of Callimachus (&lsquo;a great book is a
great evil&rsquo;) not to imitate the length of the epic. <a
name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a>&nbsp; He was also to shun close
imitation of what are so easily imitated, the regular recurring
<i>formulae</i>, the commonplace of Homer.&nbsp; He was to add
minute pictorial touches, as in the description of
Alcmena&rsquo;s waking when the serpents attacked her
child,&mdash;a passage rich in domestic pathos and incident which
contrast strongly with Pindar&rsquo;s bare narrative of the same
events.&nbsp; We have noted the same pictorial quality in the
<i>Europa</i> of Moschus.&nbsp; Our own age has often been
compared to the Alexandrian epoch, to that era of large cities,
wealth, refinement, criticism, and science; and the pictorial
<i>Idylls of the King</i> very closely resemble the epico-idyllic
manner of Alexandria.&nbsp; We have tried to examine the society
in which Theocritus lived.&nbsp; But our impressions about the
poet are more distinct.&nbsp; In him we find the most genial
character; pious as Greece counted piety; <a
name="pagexlii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xlii</span>tender as
became the poet of love; glad as the singer of a happy southern
world should be; gifted, above all, with humour, and with
dramatic power.&nbsp; &lsquo;His lyre has all the chords&rsquo;;
his is the last of all the perfect voices of Hellas; after him no
man saw life with eyes so steady and so mirthful.</p>
<p>About the lives of the three idyllic poets literary history
says little.&nbsp; About their deaths she only tells us through
the dirge by Moschus, that Bion was poisoned.&nbsp; The lovers of
Theocritus would willingly hope that he returned from Alexandria
to Sicily, about the time when he wrote the sixteenth idyl, and
that he lived in the enjoyment of the friendship and the domestic
happiness and honour which he sang so well, through the golden
age of Hiero (264 <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>)&nbsp; No
happier fortune could befall him who wrote the epigram of the
lady of heavenly love, who worshipped with the noble wife of
Nicias under the green roof of Milesian Aphrodite, and who
prophesied of the return of peace and of song to Sicily and
Syracuse.</p>

<p><i>The shepherd Thyrsis meets a goatherd</i>, <i>in a shady

Song of Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; <i>This ideal hero of Greek pastoral
song had won for his bride the fairest of the Nymphs</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Confident in the strength of his passion</i>, <i>he boasted
that Love could never subdue him to a new question</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Love avenged himself by making Daphnis desire a strange
maiden</i>, <i>but to this temptation he never yielded</i>,
<i>and so died a constant lover</i>.&nbsp; <i>The song tells how
the cattle and the wild things of the wood bewailed him</i>,
<i>how Hermes and Priapus gave him counsel in vain</i>, <i>and
how with his last breath he retorted the taunts of the implacable
Aphrodite</i>.</p>
<p><i>The scene is in Sicily</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thyrsis</i>.&nbsp; Sweet, meseems, is the whispering sound
of yonder pine tree, goatherd, that murmureth by the wells of
water; and sweet are thy pipings.&nbsp; After Pan the second
prize shalt thou bear away, and if he take the horned goat, the
she-goat shalt thou win; but if he choose the she-goat for his
meed, the kid <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>falls to thee, and dainty is the flesh of kids e&rsquo;er
the age when thou milkest them.</p>
<p><i>The Goatherd</i>.&nbsp; Sweeter, O shepherd, is thy song
than the music of yonder water that is poured from the high face
of the rock!&nbsp; Yea, if the Muses take the young ewe for their
gift, a stall-fed lamb shalt thou receive for thy meed; but if it
please them to take the lamb, thou shalt lead away the ewe for
the second prize.</p>
<p><i>Thyrsis</i>.&nbsp; Wilt thou, goatherd, in the
nymphs&rsquo; name, wilt thou sit thee down here, among the
tamarisks, on this sloping knoll, and pipe while in this place I
watch thy flocks?</p>
<p><i>Goatherd</i>.&nbsp; Nay, shepherd, it may not be; we may
not pipe in the noontide.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Pan we dread, who
truly at this hour rests weary from the chase; and bitter of mood
is he, the keen wrath sitting ever at his nostrils.&nbsp; But,
Thyrsis, for that thou surely wert wont to sing <i>The Affliction
of Daphnis</i>, and hast most deeply meditated the pastoral muse,
come hither, and beneath yonder elm let us sit down, in face of
Priapus and the fountain fairies, where is that resting-place of
the shepherds, and where the oak trees are.&nbsp; Ah! if thou
wilt but sing as on that day thou sangest in thy match with
Chromis out of Libya, I will let thee milk, ay, three times, a
goat that is the mother of twins, and even when she has suckled
her kids her milk doth fill two pails.&nbsp; A deep bowl of
ivy-wood, too, I will give thee, rubbed with sweet
bees&rsquo;-wax, a <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>twy-eared bowl newly wrought, smacking still of the knife
of the graver.&nbsp; Round its upper edges goes the ivy winding,
ivy besprent with golden flowers; and about it is a tendril
twisted that joys in its saffron fruit.&nbsp; Within is designed
a maiden, as fair a thing as the gods could fashion, arrayed in a
sweeping robe, and a snood on her head.&nbsp; Beside her two
youths with fair love-locks are contending from either side, with
alternate speech, but her heart thereby is all untouched.&nbsp;
And now on one she glances, smiling, and anon she lightly flings
the other a thought, while by reason of the long vigils of love
their eyes are heavy, but their labour is all in vain.</p>
<p>Beyond these an ancient fisherman and a rock are fashioned, a
rugged rock, whereon with might and main the old man drags a
great net for his cast, as one that labours stoutly.&nbsp; Thou
wouldst say that he is fishing with all the might of his limbs,
so big the sinews swell all about his neck, grey-haired though he
be, but his strength is as the strength of youth.&nbsp; Now
divided but a little space from the sea-worn old man is a
vineyard laden well with fire-red clusters, and on the rough wall
a little lad watches the vineyard, sitting there.&nbsp; Round him
two she-foxes are skulking, and one goes along the vine-rows to
devour the ripe grapes, and the other brings all her cunning to
bear against the scrip, and vows she will never leave the lad,
till she strand him bare and breakfastless.&nbsp; But the boy is
plaiting a pretty <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>locust-cage with stalks of asphodel, and fitting it with
reeds, and less care of his scrip has he, and of the vines, than
delight in his plaiting.</p>
<p>All about the cup is spread the soft acanthus, a miracle of
varied work, <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> a thing for thee to marvel on.&nbsp; For
this bowl I paid to a Calydonian ferryman a goat and a great
white cream cheese.&nbsp; Never has its lip touched mine, but it
still lies maiden for me.&nbsp; Gladly with this cup would I gain
thee to my desire, if thou, my friend, wilt sing me that
delightful song.&nbsp; Nay, I grudge it thee not at all.&nbsp;
Begin, my friend, for be sure thou canst in no wise carry thy
song with thee to Hades, that puts all things out of mind!</p>

is it that torments thee; child, whom dost thou love with so
great desire?&rsquo;&nbsp; The neatherds came, and the shepherds;
the goatherds came: all they asked what ailed him.&nbsp; Came
also Priapus,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>And said: &lsquo;Unhappy Daphnis, wherefore dost thou
languish, while for thee the maiden by all the fountains, through
all the glades is fleeting, in search of thee?&nbsp; Ah! thou art
too laggard a lover, and thou nothing availest!&nbsp; A neatherd
wert thou named, and now thou art like the goatherd:</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the goatherd, when he marks the young goats at
their pastime, looks on with yearning eyes, and fain would be
even as they; and thou, when thou beholdest the laughter of
maidens, dost gaze with yearning eyes, for that thou dost not
join their dances.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>Yet these the herdsman answered not again, but he bare his
bitter love to the end, yea, to the fated end he bare it.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Ay, but
she too came, the sweetly smiling Cypris, craftily smiling she
came, yet keeping her heavy anger; and she spake, saying:
&lsquo;Daphnis, methinks thou didst boast that thou wouldst throw
Love a fall, nay, is it not thyself that hast been thrown by
grievous Love?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Begin ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>But to her Daphnis answered again: &lsquo;Implacable Cypris,
Cypris terrible, Cypris of mortals detested, already dost thou
deem that my latest sun has set; nay, Daphnis even in Hades shall
prove great sorrow to Love.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where it is told how the herdsman with Cypris&mdash;Get
thee to Ida, get thee to Anchises!&nbsp; There are oak
trees&mdash;here only galingale blows, here sweetly hum the bees
about the hives!</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thine Adonis, too, is in his bloom, for he herds the
sheep and slays the hares, and he chases all the wild
beasts.&nbsp; Nay, go and confront Diomedes again, and say,
&ldquo;The herdsman Daphnis I conquered, do thou join battle with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye wolves, ye jackals, and ye bears in the mountain
caves, farewell!&nbsp; The herdsman Daphnis ye never shall see
again, no more in <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>the dells, no more in the groves, no more in the
woodlands.&nbsp; Farewell Arethusa, ye rivers, good-night, that
pour down Thymbris your beautiful waters.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Muses dear</i>, <i>begin the pastoral
song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Daphnis am I who here do herd the kine, Daphnis
who water here the bulls and calves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Pan, Pan! whether thou art on the high hills of
Lycaeus, or rangest mighty Maenalus, haste hither to the Sicilian
isle!&nbsp; Leave the tomb of Helice, leave that high cairn of
the son of Lycaon, which seems wondrous fair, even in the eyes of
the blessed. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p><i>Give o&rsquo;er</i>, <i>ye Muses</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>give
o&rsquo;er the pastoral song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come hither, my prince, and take this fair pipe,
honey-breathed with wax-stopped joints; and well it fits thy lip:
for verily I, even I, by Love am now haled to Hades.</p>
<p><i>Give o&rsquo;er</i>, <i>ye Muses</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>give
o&rsquo;er the pastoral song</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now violets bear, ye brambles, ye thorns bear violets;
and let fair narcissus bloom on the boughs of juniper!&nbsp; Let
all things with all be confounded,&mdash;from pines let men
gather pears, for Daphnis is dying!&nbsp; Let the stag <a

hounds, let owls from the hills contend in song with the
nightingales.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Give o&rsquo;er</i>, <i>ye Muses</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>give
o&rsquo;er the pastoral song</i>!</p>
<p>So Daphnis spake, and ended; but fain would Aphrodite have
given him back to life.&nbsp; Nay, spun was all the thread that
the Fates assigned, and Daphnis went down the stream.&nbsp; The
whirling wave closed over the man the Muses loved, the man not
hated of the nymphs.</p>
<p><i>Give o&rsquo;er</i>, <i>ye Muses</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>give
o&rsquo;er the pastoral song</i>!</p>
<p>And thou, give me the bowl, and the she-goat, that I may milk
her and poor forth a libation to the Muses.&nbsp; Farewell, oh,
farewells manifold, ye Muses, and I, some future day, will sing
you yet a sweeter song.</p>
<p><i>The Goatherd</i>.&nbsp; Filled may thy fair mouth be with
honey, Thyrsis, and filled with the honeycomb; and the sweet
dried fig mayst thou eat of Aegilus, for thou vanquishest the
cicala in song!&nbsp; Lo here is thy cup, see, my friend, of how
pleasant a savour!&nbsp; Thou wilt think it has been dipped in
the well-spring of the Hours.&nbsp; Hither, hither, Cissaetha: do
thou milk her, Thyrsis.&nbsp; And you young she-goats, wanton not
so wildly lest you bring up the he-goat against you.</p>

<p>Delphis troubled me, and I against Delphis am burning this

<p>Even as I melt this wax, with the god to aid, so speedily may

<p><i>My magic wheel</i>, <i>draw home to me the man I

<p>And now that I am alone, whence shall I begin to bewail my
love?&nbsp; Whence shall I take up the tale: who brought on me
this sorrow?&nbsp; The maiden-bearer of the mystic vessel came
our way, Anaxo, daughter of Eubulus, to the grove of Artemis; and
behold, she had many other wild beasts paraded for that <a

sacred show, and among them a lioness.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>And the Thracian servant of Theucharidas,&mdash;my nurse that
is but lately dead, and who then dwelt at our
doors,&mdash;besought me and implored me to come and see the
show.&nbsp; And I went with her, wretched woman that I am, clad
about in a fair and sweeping linen stole, over which I had thrown
the holiday dress of Clearista.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>Lo!&nbsp; I was now come to the mid-point of the highway, near
the dwelling of Lycon, and there I saw Delphis and Eudamippus
walking together.&nbsp; Their beards were more golden than the
golden flower of the ivy; their breasts (they coming fresh from
the glorious wrestler&rsquo;s toil) were brighter of sheen than
thyself Selene!</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>Even as I looked I loved, loved madly, and all my heart was
wounded, woe is me, and my beauty began to wane.&nbsp; No more
heed took I of that show, and how I came home I know not; but
some parching fever utterly overthrew me, and I lay a-bed ten
days and ten nights.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>And
oftentimes my skin waxed wan as the colour of boxwood, and all my
hair was falling from my head, and what was left of me was but
skin and bones.&nbsp; Was there a wizard to whom I did not seek,
or a crone to whose house I did not resort, of them that have art
magical?&nbsp; But this was no light malady, and the time went
fleeting on.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>Thus I told the true story to my maiden, and said, &lsquo;Go,
Thestylis, and find me some remedy for this sore disease.&nbsp;
Ah me, the Myndian possesses me, body and soul!&nbsp; Nay,
depart, and watch by the wrestling-ground of Timagetus, for there
is his resort, and there he loves to loiter.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when thou art sure he is alone, nod to him
secretly, and say, &ldquo;Simaetha bids thee to come to
her,&rdquo; and lead him hither privily.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I spoke;
and she went and brought the bright-limbed Delphis to my
house.&nbsp; But I, when I beheld him just crossing the threshold
of the door, with his light step,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>Grew colder all than snow, and the sweat streamed from my brow
like the dank dews, and I had no strength to speak, nay, nor to
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>utter as
much as children murmur in their slumber, calling to their mother
dear: and all my fair body turned stiff as a puppet of wax.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>Then when he had gazed on me, he that knows not love, he fixed
his eyes on the ground, and sat down on my bed, and spake as he
sat him down: &lsquo;Truly, Simaetha, thou didst by no more
outrun mine own coming hither, when thou badst me to thy roof,
than of late I outran in the race the beautiful Philinus:</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;For I should have come; yea, by sweet Love, I should
have come, with friends of mine, two or three, as soon as night
drew on, bearing in my breast the apples of Dionysus, and on my
head silvery poplar leaves, the holy boughs of Heracles, all
twined with bands of purple.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if you had received me, they would have taken it
well, for among all the youths unwed I have a name for beauty and
speed of foot.&nbsp; With one kiss of thy lovely mouth I had been
content; but an if ye had thrust me forth, and the door had been
fastened with the bar, then truly should torch and axe have
broken in upon you.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&lsquo;And now to Cypris first, methinks, my thanks are
due, and after Cypris it is thou that hast caught me, lady, from
the burning, in that thou badst me come to this thy house, half
consumed as I am!&nbsp; Yea, Love, &rsquo;tis plain, lights oft a
fiercer blaze than Hephaestus the God of Lipara.</p>
<p><i>Bethink thee of my love</i>, <i>and whence it came</i>,
<i>my Lady Moon</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;With his madness dire, he scares both the maiden from
her bower and the bride from the bridal bed, yet warm with the
body of her lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he spake, and I, that was easy to win, took his hand, and
drew him down on the soft bed beside me.&nbsp; And immediately
body from body caught fire, and our faces glowed as they had not
done, and sweetly we murmured.&nbsp; And now, dear Selene, to
tell thee no long tale, the great rites were accomplished, and we
twain came to our desire.&nbsp; Faultless was I in his sight,
till yesterday, and he, again, in mine.&nbsp; But there came to
me the mother of Philista, my flute player, and the mother of
Melixo, to-day, when the horses of the Sun were climbing the sky,
bearing Dawn of the rosy arms from the ocean stream.&nbsp; Many
another thing she told me; and chiefly this, that Delphis is a
lover, and whom he loves she vowed she knew not surely, but this
only, that ever he filled up his cup with the unmixed wine, to
drink a toast to his dearest.&nbsp; And at last he went off
hastily, <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>saying that he would cover with garlands the dwelling of
his love.</p>
<p>This news my visitor told me, and she speaks the truth.&nbsp;
For indeed, at other seasons, he would come to me thrice, or four
times, in the day, and often would leave with me his Dorian oil
flask.&nbsp; But now it is the twelfth day since I have even
looked on him!&nbsp; Can it be that he has not some other
delight, and has forgotten me?&nbsp; Now with magic rites I will
strive to bind him, <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> but if still he
vexes me, he shall beat, by the Fates I vow it, at the gate of
Hell.&nbsp; Such evil medicines I store against him in a certain
coffer, the use whereof, my lady, an Assyrian stranger taught
me.</p>
<p>But do thou farewell, and turn thy steeds to Ocean, Lady, and
my pain I will bear, as even till now I have endured it.&nbsp;
Farewell, Selene bright and fair, farewell ye other stars, that
follow the wheels of quiet Night.</p>

<p>Now know I Love, and a cruel God is he.&nbsp; Surely he sucked

<p>Ah, lovely as thou art to look upon, ah heart of stone, ah

kiss thee, and even in empty kisses there is a sweet delight!</p>
<p>Soon wilt thou make me rend the wreath in pieces small, the

rose-buds twined, and fragrant parsley.&nbsp; Ah me, what
anguish!&nbsp; Wretched that I am, whither shall I turn!&nbsp;
Thou dust not hear my prayer!</p>
<p>I will cast off my coat of skins, and into yonder waves I will
spring, where the fisher Olpis watches for the tunny shoals, and
even if I die not, surely thy pleasure will have been done.</p>
<p>I learned the truth of old, when, amid thoughts of thee, I
asked, &lsquo;Loves she, loves she not?&rsquo; and the poppy
petal clung not, and gave no crackling sound, but withered on my
smooth forearm, even so. <a name="citation21"></a><a

<p>And she too spoke sooth, even Agroeo, she that divineth with a
sieve, and of late was binding sheaves behind the reapers, who
said that <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>I had set all my heart on thee, but that thou didst
nothing regard me.</p>
<p>Truly I keep for thee the white goat with the twin kids that
Mermnon&rsquo;s daughter too, the brown-skinned Erithacis, prays
me to give her; and give her them I will, since thou dost flout
me.</p>
<p>My right eyelid throbs, is it a sign that I am to see
her?&nbsp; Here will I lean me against this pine tree, and sing,
and then perchance she will regard me, for she is not all of
adamant.</p>
<p>Lo, Hippomenes when he was eager to marry the famous maiden,
took apples in his hand, and so accomplished his course; and
Atalanta saw, and madly longed, and leaped into the deep waters
of desire.&nbsp; Melampus too, the soothsayer, brought the herd
of oxen from Othrys to Pylos, and thus in the arms of Bias was
laid the lovely mother of wise Alphesiboea.</p>
<p>And was it not thus that Adonis, as he pastured his sheep upon
the hills, led beautiful Cytherea to such heights of frenzy, that
not even in his death doth she unclasp him from her bosom?&nbsp;
Blessed, methinks is the lot of him that sleeps, and tosses not,
nor turns, even Endymion; and, dearest maiden, blessed I call
Iason, whom such things befell, as ye that be profane shall never
come to know.</p>
<p>My head aches, but thou carest not.&nbsp; I will sing no more,
but dead will I lie where I fall, and here may the wolves devour
me.</p>

Neaethus, where all fair herbs bloom, red goat-wort, and endive,
and fragrant bees-wort.</p>

will go to Hades, while thou too art in love with a luckless
victory, and thy pipe is flecked with mildew, the pipe that once
thou madest for thyself!</p>
<p><i>Corydon</i>.&nbsp; Not the pipe, by the nymphs, not so, for
when he went to Pisa, he left the same as a gift to me, and I am
something of a player.&nbsp; Well can I strike up the air of
<i>Glauc&eacute;</i> and well the strain of <i>Pyrrhus</i>, and
<i>the praise of Croton I sing</i>, and <i>Zacynthus is a goodly
town</i>, and <i>Lacinium that fronts the dawn</i>!&nbsp; There
Aegon the boxer, unaided, devoured eighty cakes to his own share,
and there he caught the bull by the hoof, and brought him from
the mountain, and gave him to Amaryllis.&nbsp; Thereon the women
shrieked aloud, and the neatherd,&mdash;he burst out
laughing.</p>

even in death will we ne&rsquo;er forget.&nbsp; Dear to me as my

comforted.&nbsp; The morrow perchance will bring better
fortune.&nbsp; The living may hope, the dead alone are
hopeless.&nbsp; Zeus now shows bright and clear, and anon he
rains.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Enough of thy comforting!&nbsp; Drive the
calves from the lower ground, the cursed beasts are grazing on
the olive-shoots.&nbsp; Hie on, white face.</p>

Dost thou not hear?&nbsp; By Pan, I will soon come and be the
death of you, if you stay there!&nbsp; Look, here she is creeping
back again!&nbsp; Would I had my crook for hare killing: how I
would cudgel thee.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; In the name of Zeus, prithee look here,
Corydon!&nbsp; A thorn has just run into my foot under the
ankle.&nbsp; How deep they grow, the arrow-headed thorns.&nbsp;
An ill end befall the heifer; I was pricked when I was gaping
after her.&nbsp; Prithee dost see it?</p>
<p><i>Corydon</i>.&nbsp; Yes, yes, and I have caught it in my
nails, see, here it is.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; How tiny is the wound, and how tall a man
it masters!</p>
<p><i>Corydon</i>.&nbsp; When thou goest to the hill, go not
barefoot, Battus, for on the hillside flourish thorns and
brambles plenty.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Come, tell me, Corydon, the old man now,
does he still run after that little black-browed darling whom he
used to dote on?</p>
<p><i>Corydon</i>.&nbsp; He is after her still, my lad; but
yesterday I came upon them, by the very byre, and right loving
were they.</p>

<p><i>This Idyl begins with a ribald debate between two
hirelings</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>at last</i>, <i>compete with each
other in a match of pastoral song</i>.&nbsp; <i>No other idyl of
Theocritus is so frankly true to the rough side of rustic
manners</i>.&nbsp; <i>The scene is in Southern Italy</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Goats of mine, keep clear of that
notorious shepherd of Sibyrtas, that Lacon; he stole my goat-skin
yesterday.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Will ye never leave the well-head?&nbsp;
Off, my lambs, see ye not Comatas; him that lately stole my
shepherd&rsquo;s pipe?</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; What manner of pipe might that be, for
when gat&rsquo;st <i>thou</i> a pipe, thou slave of
Sibyrtas?&nbsp; Why does it no more suffice thee to keep a flute
of straw, and whistle with Corydon?</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; What pipe, free sir? why, the pipe that
Lycon gave me.&nbsp; And what manner of goat-skin hadst thou,
that Lacon made off with?&nbsp; Tell me, Comatas, for truly even
thy master, Eumarides, had never a goat-skin to sleep in.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the skin that Crocylus gave
me, the dappled one, when he sacrificed the she-goat to the
nymphs; but thou, wretch, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>even then wert wasting with envy, and
now, at last, thou hast stripped me bare!</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Nay verily, so help me Pan of the
seashore, it was not Lacon the son of Calaethis that filched the
coat of skin.&nbsp; If I lie, sirrah, may I leap frenzied down
this rock into the Crathis!</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Nay verily, my friend, so help me these
nymphs of the mere (and ever may they be favourable, as now, and
kind to me), it was not Comatas that pilfered thy pipe.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; If I believe thee, may I suffer the
afflictions of Daphnis!&nbsp; But see, if thou carest to stake a
kid&mdash;though indeed &rsquo;tis scarce worth my
while&mdash;then, go to, I will sing against thee, and cease not,
till thou dust cry &lsquo;enough!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; <i>The sow defied Athene</i>!&nbsp; See,
there is staked the kid, go to, do thou too put a fatted lamb
against him, for thy stake.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Thou fox, and where would be our even
betting then?&nbsp; Who ever chose hair to shear, in place of
wool? and who prefers to milk a filthy bitch, when he can have a
she-goat, nursing her first kid?</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Why, he that deems himself as sure of
getting the better of his neighbour as thou dost, a wasp that
buzzes against the cicala.&nbsp; But as it is plain thou thinkst
the kid no fair stake, lo, here is this he-goat.&nbsp; Begin the
match!</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; No such haste, thou art not on fire!&nbsp;
More sweetly wilt thou sing, if thou wilt sit down beneath the
wild olive tree, and the <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>groves in this place.&nbsp; Chill
water falls there, drop by drop, here grows the grass, and here a
leafy bed is strown, and here the locusts prattle.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Nay, no whit am I in haste, but I am
sorely vexed, that thou shouldst dare to look me straight in the
face, thou whom I used to teach while thou wert still a
child.&nbsp; See where gratitude goes!&nbsp; As well rear
wolf-whelps, breed hounds, that they may devour thee!</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; And what good thing have I to remember
that I ever learned or heard from thee, thou envious thing, thou
mere hideous manikin!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p>But come this way, come, and thou shalt sing thy last of
country song.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; That way I will not go!&nbsp; Here be
oak trees, and here the galingale, and sweetly here hum the bees
about the hives.&nbsp; There are two wells of chill water, and on
the tree the birds are warbling, and the shadow is beyond compare
with that where thou liest, and from on high the pine tree pelts
us with her cones.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Nay, but lambs&rsquo; wool, truly, and
fleeces, shalt thou tread here, if thou wilt but
come,&mdash;fleeces more soft than sleep, but the goat-skins
beside thee stink&mdash;worse than thyself.&nbsp; And I will set
a great bowl of white milk for the nymphs, and another will I
offer of sweet olive oil.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Nay, but an if thou wilt come, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>thou shalt
tread here the soft feathered fern, and flowering thyme, and
beneath thee shall be strown the skins of she-goats, four times
more soft than the fleeces of thy lambs.&nbsp; And I will set out
eight bowls of milk for Pan, and eight bowls full of the richest
honeycombs.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Thence, where thou art, I pray thee, begin
the match, and there sing thy country song, tread thine own
ground and keep thine oaks to thyself.&nbsp; But who, who shall
judge between us?&nbsp; Would that Lycopas, the neatherd, might
chance to come this way!</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; I want nothing with him, but that man,
if thou wilt, that woodcutter we will call, who is gathering
those tufts of heather near thee.&nbsp; It is Morson.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Let us shout, then!</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Call thou to him.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Ho, friend, come hither and listen for a
little while, for we two have a match to prove which is the
better singer of country song.&nbsp; So Morson, my friend,
neither judge me too kindly, no, nor show him favour.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Yes, dear Morson, for the nymphs&rsquo;
sake neither lean in thy judgment to Comatas, nor, prithee,
favour <i>him</i>.&nbsp; The flock of sheep thou seest here
belongs to Sibyrtas of Thurii, and the goats, friend, that thou
beholdest are the goats of Eumarides of Sybaris.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Now, in the name of Zeus did any one ask
thee, thou make-mischief, who owned the flock, I or
Sibyrtas?&nbsp; What a chatterer thou art!</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Best of men, I am for speaking the
whole truth, and boasting never, but thou art too fond of cutting
speeches.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Come, say whatever thou hast to say, and
let the stranger get home to the city alive; oh, Paean, what a
babbler thou art, Comatas!</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Singing Match</span>.</h4>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; The Muses love me better far than the
minstrel Daphnis; but a little while ago I sacrificed two young
she-goats to the Muses.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Yea, and me too Apollo loves very dearly,
and a noble ram I rear for Apollo, for the feast of the Carnea,
look you, is drawing nigh.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; The she-goats that I milk have all borne
twins save two.&nbsp; The maiden saw me, and &lsquo;alas,&rsquo;
she cried, &lsquo;dost thou milk alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Ah, ah, but Lacon here hath nigh twenty
baskets full of cheese, and Lacon lies with his darling in the
flowers!</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Clearista, too, pelts the goatherd with
apples as he drives past his she-goats, and a sweet word she
murmurs.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; And wild with love am I too, for my fair
young darling, that meets the shepherd, with the bright hair
floating round the shapely neck.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Nay, ye may not liken dog-roses to the
rose, or wind-flowers to the roses of the garden; by the garden
walls their beds are blossoming.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Nay, nor wild apples to acorns, for
acorns are bitter in the oaken rind, but apples are sweet as
honey.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Soon will I give my maiden a ring-dove
for a gift; I will take it from the juniper tree, for there it is
brooding.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; But I will give my darling a soft fleece
to make a cloak, a free gift, when I shear the black ewe.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Forth from the wild olive, my bleating
she-goats, feed here where the hillside slopes, and the tamarisks
grove.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Conarus there, and Cynaetha, will you
never leave the oak?&nbsp; Graze here, where Phalarus feeds,
where the hillside fronts the dawn.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Ay, and I have a vessel of cypress wood,
and a mixing bowl, the work of Praxiteles, and I hoard them for
my maiden.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; I too have a dog that loves the flock, the
dog to strangle wolves; him I am giving to my darling to chase
all manner of wild beasts.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Ye locusts that overleap our fence, see
that ye harm not our vines, for our vines are young.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Ye cicalas, see how I make the goatherd
chafe: even so, methinks, do ye vex the reapers.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; I hate the foxes, with their bushy
brushes, that ever come at evening, and eat the grapes of
Micon.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; And I hate the lady-birds that <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>devour the
figs of Philondas, and flit down the wind.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Dost thou not remember how I cudgelled
thee, and thou didst grin and nimbly writhe, and catch hold of
yonder oak?</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; That I have no memory of, but how
Eumarides bound thee there, upon a time, and flogged thee through
and through, that I do very well remember.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Already, Morson, some one is waxing
bitter, dust thou see no sign of it?&nbsp; Go, go, and pluck,
forthwith, the squills from some old wife&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; And I too, Morson, I make some one chafe,
and thou dost perceive it.&nbsp; Be off now to the Hales stream,
and dig cyclamen.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Let Himera flow with milk instead of
water, and thou, Crathis, run red with wine, and all thy reeds
bear apples.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; Would that the fount of Sybaris may flow
with honey, and may the maiden&rsquo;s pail, at dawning, be
dipped, not in water, but in the honeycomb.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; My goats eat cytisus, and goatswort, and
tread the lentisk shoots, and lie at ease among the arbutus.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; But my ewes have honey-wort to feed on,
and luxuriant creepers flower around, as fair as roses.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; I love not Alcippe, for yesterday she
did not kiss me, and take my face between her hands, when I gave
her the dove.</p>
<p><i>Lacon</i>.&nbsp; But deeply I love my darling, for a <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>kind kiss
once I got, in return for the gift of a shepherd&rsquo;s
pipe.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; Lacon, it never was right that pyes
should contend with the nightingale, nor hoopoes with swans, but
thou, unhappy swain, art ever for contention.</p>
<p><i>Morson&rsquo;s Judgement</i>.&nbsp; I bid the shepherd
cease.&nbsp; But to thee, Comatas, Morson presents the
lamb.&nbsp; And thou, when thou hast sacrificed her to the
nymphs, send Morson, anon, a goodly portion of her flesh.</p>
<p><i>Comatas</i>.&nbsp; I will, by Pan.&nbsp; Now leap, and
snort, my he-goats, all the herd of you, and see here how loud I
ever will laugh, and exult over Lacon, the shepherd, for that, at
last, I have won the lamb.&nbsp; See, I will leap sky high with
joy.&nbsp; Take heart, my horned goats, to-morrow I will dip you
all in the fountain of Sybaris.&nbsp; Thou white he-goat, I will
beat thee if thou dare to touch one of the herd before I
sacrifice the lamb to the nymphs.&nbsp; There he is at it
again!&nbsp; Call me Melanthius, <a name="citation34"></a><a

not cudgel thee.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Damoetas</span>, and Daphnis the herdsman,
once on a time, Aratus, led the flock together into one
place.&nbsp; Golden was the down on the chin of one, the beard of
the other was half-grown, and by a well-head the twain sat them
down, in the summer noon, and thus they sang.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
Daphnis that began the singing, for the challenge had come from
Daphnis.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Daphnis&rsquo;s Song of the
Cyclops</i>.</p>
<p>Galatea is pelting thy flock with apples, Polyphemus, she says
the goatherd is a laggard lover!&nbsp; And thou dost not glance
at her, oh hard, hard that thou art, but still thou sittest at
thy sweet piping.&nbsp; Ah see, again, she is pelting thy dog,
that follows thee to watch thy sheep.&nbsp; He barks, as he looks
into the brine, and now the beautiful waves that softly plash <a

Ah, thence again, see, she is wantoning, light as dry
thistle-down in the scorching summer weather.&nbsp; She flies
when thou art wooing her; when thou woo&rsquo;st not she pursues
thee, she plays out all her game and leaves her king
unguarded.&nbsp; For truly to Love, Polyphemus, many a time doth
foul seem fair!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>He ended and Damoetas touched a

things, hateful things take home, to keep them for his
children!&nbsp; But it is all to torment her, that I, in my turn,
give not back her glances, pretending that I have another
love.&nbsp; To hear this makes her jealous of me, by Paean, and
she wastes with pain, and springs madly from the sea, gazing at
my caves and at my herds.&nbsp; And I hiss on my dog to bark at
her, for when I loved Galatea he would whine with joy, and lay
his muzzle on her lap.&nbsp; Perchance when she marks how I use
her she will send me many a messenger, but on her envoys I will
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>shut my
door till she promises that herself will make a glorious
bridal-bed on this island for me.&nbsp; For in truth, I am not so
hideous as they say!&nbsp; But lately I was looking into the sea,
when all was calm; beautiful seemed my beard, beautiful my one
eye&mdash;as I count beauty&mdash;and the sea reflected the gleam
of my teeth whiter than the Parian stone.&nbsp; Then, all to shun
the evil eye, did I spit thrice in my breast; for this spell was
taught me by the crone, Cottytaris, that piped of yore to the
reapers in Hippocoon&rsquo;s field.</p>
<p>Then Damoetas kissed Daphnis, as he ended his song, and he
gave Daphnis a pipe, and Daphnis gave him a beautiful
flute.&nbsp; Damoetas fluted, and Daphnis piped, the
herdsman,&mdash;and anon the calves were dancing in the soft
green grass.&nbsp; Neither won the victory, but both were
invincible.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Harvest Feast</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> fell upon a time when Eucritus
and I were walking from the city to the Hales water, and Amyntas
was the third in our company.&nbsp; The harvest-feast of Deo was
then being held by Phrasidemus and Antigenes, two sons of
Lycopeus (if aught there be of noble and old descent), <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>whose lineage
dates from Clytia, and Chalcon himself&mdash;Chalcon, beneath
whose foot the fountain sprang, the well of Burin&eacute;.&nbsp;
He set his knee stoutly against the rock, and straightway by the
spring poplars and elm trees showed a shadowy glade, arched
overhead they grew, and pleached with leaves of green.&nbsp; We
had not yet reached the mid-point of the way, nor was the tomb of
Brasilas yet risen upon our sight, when,&mdash;thanks be to the
Muses&mdash;we met a certain wayfarer, the best of men, a
Cydonian.&nbsp; Lycidas was his name, a goatherd was he, nor
could any that saw him have taken him for other than he was, for
all about him bespoke the goatherd.&nbsp; Stripped from the
roughest of he-goats was the tawny skin he wore on his shoulders,
the smell of rennet clinging to it still, and about his breast an
old cloak was buckled with a plaited belt, and in his right hand
he carried a crooked staff of wild olive: and quietly he accosted
me, with a smile, a twinkling eye, and a laugh still on his
lips:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Simichidas, whither, pray, through the noon dost thou
trail thy feet, when even the very lizard on the rough stone wall
is sleeping, and the crested larks no longer fare afield?&nbsp;
Art thou hastening to a feast, a bidden guest, or art thou for
treading a townsman&rsquo;s wine-press?&nbsp; For such is thy
speed that every stone upon the way spins singing from thy
boots!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lycidas,&rsquo; I answered him, &lsquo;they all
say that thou among herdsmen, yea, and reapers art far the
chiefest flute-player.&nbsp; In sooth this <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>greatly
rejoices our hearts, and yet, to my conceit, meseems I can vie
with thee.&nbsp; But as to this journey, we are going to the
harvest-feast, for, look you some friends of ours are paying a
festival to fair-robed Demeter, out of the first-fruits of their
increase, for verily in rich measure has the goddess filled their
threshing-floor with barley grain.&nbsp; But come, for the way
and the day are thine alike and mine, come, let us vie in
pastoral song, perchance each will make the other delight.&nbsp;
For I, too, am a clear-voiced mouth of the Muses, and they all
call me the best of minstrels, but I am not so credulous; no, by
Earth, for to my mind I cannot as yet conquer in song that great
Sicelidas&mdash;the Samian&mdash;nay, nor yet Philetas.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a match of frog against cicala!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I spoke, to win my end, and the goatherd with his sweet
laugh, said, &lsquo;I give thee this staff, because thou art a
sapling of Zeus, and in thee is no guile.&nbsp; For as I hate
your builders that try to raise a house as high as the mountain
summit of Oromedon, <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> so I hate all birds
of the Muses that vainly toil with their cackling notes against
the Minstrel of Chios!&nbsp; But come, Simichidas, without more
ado let us begin the pastoral song.&nbsp; And I&mdash;nay, see
friend&mdash;if it please thee at all, this ditty that I lately
fashioned on the mountain side!&rsquo;</p>

Aphrodite, for hot is the love that consumes me.</p>

that day, will go crowned with anise, or with a rosy wreath, or a

for me, in the embers.&nbsp; And elbow-deep shall the flowery bed

<p>And he shall sing how, once upon a time, the great chest
prisoned the living goatherd, by his lord&rsquo;s infatuate and
evil will, and how the blunt-faced bees, as they came up from the
meadow to the fragrant cedar chest, fed him with food of tender
flowers, because the Muse still dropped sweet nectar on his lips.
<a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a></p>
<p>O blessed Comatas, surely these joyful things befell thee, and
thou wast enclosed within the chest, and feeding on the honeycomb
through the springtime didst thou serve out thy bondage.&nbsp;
Ah, would that in my days thou hadst been numbered with the
living, how gladly on the hills would I have herded thy pretty
she-goats, and listened to thy voice, whilst thou, under oaks or
pine trees lying, didst sweetly sing, divine Comatas!</p>
<p>When he had chanted thus much he ceased, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and I
followed after him again, with some such words as
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lycidas, many another song the Nymphs have taught
me also, as I followed my herds upon the hillside, bright songs
that Rumour, perchance, has brought even to the throne of
Zeus.&nbsp; But of them all this is far the most excellent,
wherewith I will begin to do thee honour: nay listen as thou art
dear to the Muses.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Song of Simichidas</i>.</p>
<p>For Simichidas the Loves have sneezed, for truly the wretch
loves Myrto as dearly as goats love the spring. <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; But Aratus, far the dearest of my
friends, deep, deep his heart he keeps Desire,&mdash;and
Aratus&rsquo;s love is young!&nbsp; Aristis knows it, an
honourable man, nay of men the best, whom even Phoebus would
permit to stand and sing lyre in hand, by his tripods.&nbsp;
Aristis knows how deeply love is burning Aratus to the
bone.&nbsp; Ah, Pan, thou lord of the beautiful plain of Homole,
bring, I pray thee, the darling of Aratus unbidden to his arms,
whosoe&rsquo;er it be that he loves.&nbsp; If this thou dost,
dear Pan, then never may the boys of Arcady flog thy sides and
shoulders with stinging herbs, when scanty meats are left them on
thine altar.&nbsp; But if thou shouldst otherwise decree, then
may all thy skin be frayed and torn with thy nails, yea, and in
nettles mayst <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>thou couch!&nbsp; In the hills of the Edonians mayst
thou dwell in mid-winter time, by the river Hebrus, close
neighbour to the Polar star!&nbsp; But in summer mayst thou range
with the uttermost &AElig;thiopians beneath the rock of the
Blemyes, whence Nile no more is seen.</p>
<p>And you, leave ye the sweet fountain of Hyetis and Byblis, and
ye that dwell in the steep home of golden Dione, ye Loves as rosy
as red apples, strike me with your arrows, the desired, the
beloved; strike, for that ill-starred one pities not my friend,
my host!&nbsp; And yet assuredly the pear is over-ripe, and the
maidens cry &lsquo;alas, alas, thy fair bloom fades
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Come, no more let us mount guard by these gates, Aratus, nor
wear our feet away with knocking there.&nbsp; Nay, let the
crowing of the morning cock give others over to the bitter cold
of dawn.&nbsp; Let Molon alone, my friend, bear the torment at
that school of passion!&nbsp; For us, let us secure a quiet life,
and some old crone to spit on us for luck, and so keep all
unlovely things away.</p>
<p>Thus I sang, and sweetly smiling, as before, he gave me the
staff, a pledge of brotherhood in the Muses.&nbsp; Then he bent
his way to the left, and took the road to Pyxa, while I and
Eucritus, with beautiful Amyntas, turned to the farm of
Phrasidemus.&nbsp; There we reclined on deep beds of fragrant
lentisk, lowly strown, and rejoicing we lay in new stript leaves
of the vine.&nbsp; And high above our heads waved many a poplar,
many an elm tree, while close at hand <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the sacred water from the
nymphs&rsquo; own cave welled forth with murmurs musical.&nbsp;
On shadowy boughs the burnt cicalas kept their chattering toil,
far off the little owl cried in the thick thorn brake, the larks
and finches were singing, the ring-dove moaned, the yellow bees
were flitting about the springs.&nbsp; All breathed the scent of
the opulent summer, of the season of fruits; pears at our feet
and apples by our sides were rolling plentiful, the tender
branches, with wild plums laden, were earthward bowed, and the
four-year-old pitch seal was loosened from the mouth of the
wine-jars.</p>
<p>Ye nymphs of Castaly that hold the steep of Parnassus, say,
was it ever a bowl like this that old Chiron set before Heracles
in the rocky cave of Pholus?&nbsp; Was it nectar like this that
beguiled the shepherd to dance and foot it about his folds, the
shepherd that dwelt by Anapus, on a time, the strong Polyphemus
who hurled at ships with mountains?&nbsp; Had these ever such a
draught as ye nymphs bade flow for us by the altar of Demeter of
the threshing-floor?</p>
<p>Ah, once again may I plant the great fan on her corn-heap,
while she stands smiling by, with sheaves and poppies in her
hands.</p>

<p><i>The scene is among the high mountain pastures of
Sicily</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<i>On the sward</i>, <i>at the cliff
top</i><br />
<i>Lie strewn the white flocks</i>;&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>and far below shines and murmurs the Sicilian
sea</i>.&nbsp; <i>Here Daphnis and Menalcas</i>, <i>two herdsmen
of the golden age</i>, <i>meet</i>, <i>while still in their
earliest youth</i>, <i>and contend for the prize of
pastoral</i>.&nbsp; <i>Their songs</i>, <i>in elegiac
measure</i>, <i>are variations on the themes of love and
friendship</i> (<i>for Menalcas sings of Milon</i>, <i>Daphnis of
Nais</i>), <i>and of nature</i>.&nbsp; <i>Daphnis is the
winner</i>; <i>it is his earliest victory</i>, <i>and the prelude
to his great renown among nymphs and shepherds</i>.&nbsp; <i>In
this version the strophes are arranged as in Fritzsche&rsquo;s
text</i>.&nbsp; <i>Some critics take the poem to be a patchwork
by various hands</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> beautiful Daphnis was following
his kine, and Menalcas shepherding his flock, they met, as men
tell, on the long ranges of the hills.&nbsp; The beards of both
had still the first golden bloom, both were in their earliest
youth, both were pipe-players skilled, both skilled in
song.&nbsp; Then first Menalcas, looking at Daphnis, thus bespoke
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Daphnis, thou herdsman of the lowing kine, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>art thou
minded to sing a match with me?&nbsp; Methinks I shall vanquish
thee, when I sing in turn, as readily as I please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Daphnis answered him again in this wise, &lsquo;Thou
shepherd of the fleecy sheep, Menalcas, the pipe-player, never
wilt thou vanquish me in song, not thou, if thou shouldst sing
till some evil thing befall thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Dost thou care then, to try this and
see, dost thou care to risk a stake?</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; I do care to try this and see, a stake I
am ready to risk.</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; But what shall we stake, what pledge
shall we find equal and sufficient?</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; I will pledge a calf, and do thou put
down a lamb, one that has grown to his mother&rsquo;s height.</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Nay, never will I stake a lamb, for
stern is my father, and stern my mother, and they number all the
sheep at evening.</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; But what, then, wilt thou lay, and where
is to be the victor&rsquo;s gain?</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; The pipe, the fair pipe with nine
stops, that I made myself, fitted with white wax, and smoothed
evenly, above as below.&nbsp; This would I readily wager, but
never will I stake aught that is my father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; See then, I too, in truth, have a pipe
with nine stops, fitted with white wax, and smoothed evenly,
above as below.&nbsp; But lately I put it together, and this
finger still aches, where the reed split, and cut it deeply.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; But who is to judge between us,
who will listen to our singing?</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; That goatherd yonder, he will do, if we
call him hither, the man for whom that dog, a black hound with a
white patch, is barking among the kids.</p>
<p>Then the boys called aloud, and the goatherd gave ear, and
came, and the boys began to sing, and the goatherd was willing to
be their umpire.&nbsp; And first Menalcas sang (for he drew the
lot) the sweet-voiced Menalcas, and Daphnis took up the answering
strain of pastoral song&mdash;and &rsquo;twas thus Menalcas
began:</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Ye glades, ye rivers, issue of the
Gods, if ever Menalcas the flute-player sang a song ye loved, to
please him, feed his lambs; and if ever Daphnis come hither with
his calves, nay he have no less a boon.</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; Ye wells and pastures, sweet growth
o&rsquo; the world, if Daphnis sings like the nightingales, do ye
fatten this herd of his, and if Menalcas hither lead a flock, may
he too have pasture ungrudging to his full desire!</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; There doth the ewe bear twins, and
there the goats; there the bees fill the hives, and there oaks
grow loftier than common, wheresoever beautiful Milon&rsquo;s
feet walk wandering; ah, if he depart, then withered and lean is
the shepherd, and lean the pastures</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; Everywhere is spring, and pastures
everywhere, and everywhere the cows&rsquo; udders are swollen
with milk, and the younglings are fostered, wheresoever fair Nais
roams; ah, if <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>she depart, then parched are the kine, and he that feeds
them!</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; O bearded goat, thou mate of the white
herd, and O ye blunt-faced kids, where are the manifold deeps of
the forest, thither get ye to the water, for thereby is Milon;
go, thou hornless goat, and say to him, &lsquo;Milon, Proteus was
a herdsman, and that of seals, though he was a god.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>. . . .</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Not mine be the land of Pelops, not
mine to own talents of gold, nay, nor mine to outrun the speed of
the winds!&nbsp; Nay, but beneath this rock will I sing, with
thee in mine arms, and watch our flocks feeding together, and,
before us, the Sicilian sea.</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i> . . . .</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i> . . . .</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; Tempest is the dread pest of the trees,
drought of the waters, snares of the birds, and the
hunter&rsquo;s net of the wild beasts, but ruinous to man is the
love of a delicate maiden.&nbsp; O father, O Zeus, I have not
been the only lover, thou too hast longed for a mortal woman.</p>
<p>Thus the boys sang in verses amoebaean, and thus Menalcas
began the crowning lay:</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Wolf, spare the kids, spare the mothers
of my herd, and harm not me, so young as I am to tend so great a
flock.&nbsp; Ah, Lampurus, my dog, dost thou then sleep so
soundly? a dog should not sleep so sound, that helps a boyish
shepherd.&nbsp; Ewes of mine, spare ye not to take your fill of
the tender herb, ye <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>shall not weary, &rsquo;ere all this grass grows
again.&nbsp; Hist, feed on, feed on, fill, all of you, your
udders, that there may be milk for the lambs, and somewhat for me
to store away in the cheese-crates.</p>
<p>Then Daphnis followed again, and sweetly preluded to his
singing:</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; Me, even me, from the cave, the girl
with meeting eyebrows spied yesterday as I was driving past my
calves, and she cried, &lsquo;How fair, how fair he
is!&rsquo;&nbsp; But I answered her never the word of railing,
but cast down my eyes, and plodded on my way.</p>
<p>Sweet is the voice of the heifer, sweet her breath, <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a> sweet to lie beneath the sky in summer,
by running water.</p>
<p>Acorns are the pride of the oak, apples of the apple tree, the
calf of the heifer, and the neatherd glories in his kine.</p>
<p>So sang the lads; and the goatherd thus bespoke them,
&lsquo;Sweet is thy mouth, O Daphnis, and delectable thy
song!&nbsp; Better is it to listen to thy singing, than to taste
the honeycomb.&nbsp; Take thou the pipe, for thou hast conquered
in the singing match.&nbsp; Ah, if thou wilt but teach some lay,
even to me, as I tend the goats beside thee, this blunt-horned
she-goat will I give thee, for the price of thy teaching, this
she-goat that ever fills the milking pail above the
brim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then was the boy as glad,&mdash;and leaped high, and clapped
his hands over his victory,&mdash;as a young fawn leaps about his
mother.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>But the heart of the other was wasted with grief, and
desolate, even as a maiden sorrows that is newly wed.</p>
<p>From this time Daphnis became the foremost among the
shepherds, and while yet in his earliest youth, he wedded the
nymph Nais.</p>

IX</h3>
<p><i>Daphnis and Menalcas</i>, <i>at the bidding of the
poet</i>, <i>sing the joys of the neatherds and of the shepherds
life</i>.&nbsp; <i>Both receive the thanks of the poet</i>,
<i>and rustic prizes</i>&mdash;<i>a staff and a horn</i>, <i>made
of a spiral shell</i>.&nbsp; <i>Doubts have been expressed as to
the authenticity of the prelude and concluding verses</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The latter breathe all Theocritus&rsquo;s enthusiastic love of
song</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sing</span>, Daphnis, a pastoral lay, do
thou first begin the song, the song begin, O Daphnis; but let
Menalcas join in the strain, when ye have mated the heifers and
their calves, the barren kine and the bulls.&nbsp; Let them all
pasture together, let them wander in the coppice, but never leave
the herd.&nbsp; Chant thou for me, first, and on the other side
let Menalcas reply.</p>
<p><i>Daphnis</i>.&nbsp; Ah, sweetly lows the calf, and sweetly
the heifer, sweetly sounds the neatherd with his pipe, and
sweetly also I!&nbsp; My bed of leaves is strown by the cool
water, and thereon are heaped fair skins from the white calves
that were all browsing upon the arbutus, on a time, when the
south-west wind dashed me them from the height.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>And
thus I heed no more the scorching summer, than a lover cares to
heed the words of father or of mother.</p>
<p>So Daphnis sang to me, and thus, in turn, did Menalcas
sing.</p>
<p><i>Menalcas</i>.&nbsp; Aetna, mother mine, I too dwell in a
beautiful cavern in the chamber of the rock, and, lo, all the
wealth have I that we behold in dreams; ewes in plenty and
she-goats abundant, their fleeces are strown beneath my head and
feet.&nbsp; In the fire of oak-faggots puddings are hissing-hot,
and dry beech-nuts roast therein, in the wintry weather, and,
truly, for the winter season I care not even so much as a
toothless man does for walnuts, when rich pottage is beside
him.</p>
<p>Then I clapped my hands in their honour, and instantly gave
each a gift, to Daphnis a staff that grew in my father&rsquo;s
close, self-shapen, yet so straight, that perchance even a
craftsman could have found no fault in it.&nbsp; To the other I
gave a goodly spiral shell, the meat that filled it once I had
eaten after stalking the fish on the Icarian rocks (I cut it into
five shares for five of us),&mdash;and Menalcas blew a blast on
the shell.</p>
<p>Ye pastoral Muses, farewell!&nbsp; Bring ye into the light the
song that I sang there to these shepherds on that day!&nbsp;
Never let the pimple grow on my tongue-tip. <a

<p><i>This is an idyl of the same genre as Idyl IV</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The sturdy reaper</i>, <i>Milon</i>, <i>as he levels the
swathes of corn</i>, <i>derides his languid and love-worn
companion</i>, <i>Buttus</i>.&nbsp; <i>The latter defends his
gipsy love in verses which have been the keynote of much later
poetry</i>, <i>and which echo in the fourth book of
Lucretius</i>, <i>and in the Misanthrope of
Moli&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; <i>Milon replies with the song of
Lityerses</i>&mdash;<i>a string</i>, <i>apparently</i>, <i>of
popular rural couplets</i>, <i>such as Theocritus may have heard
chanted in the fields</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; Thou toilsome clod; what ails thee now,
thou wretched fellow?&nbsp; Canst thou neither cut thy swathe
straight, as thou wert wont to do, nor keep time with thy
neighbour in thy reaping, but thou must fall out, like an ewe
that is foot-pricked with a thorn and straggles from the
herd?&nbsp; What manner of man wilt thou prove after mid-noon,
and at evening, thou that dost not prosper with thy swathe when
thou art fresh begun?</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Milon, thou that canst toil till late,
thou chip of the stubborn stone, has it never befallen thee to
long for one that was not with thee?</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

man to do with hankering after what he has not got?</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Then it never befell thee to lie awake
for love?</p>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; Forbid it; &rsquo;tis an ill thing to let
the dog once taste of pudding.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; But I, Milon, am in love for almost
eleven days!</p>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis easily seen that thou drawest
from a wine-cask, while even vinegar is scarce with me.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; And for Love&rsquo;s sake, the fields
before my doors are untilled since seed-time.</p>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; But which of the girls afflicts thee
so?</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; The daughter of Polybotas, she that of
late was wont to pipe to the reapers on Hippocoon&rsquo;s
farm.</p>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; God has found out the guilty!&nbsp; Thou
hast what thou&rsquo;st long been seeking, that grasshopper of a
girl will lie by thee the night long!</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Thou art beginning thy mocks of me, but
Plutus is not the only blind god; he too is blind, the heedless
Love!&nbsp; Beware of talking big.</p>
<p><i>Milan</i>.&nbsp; Talk big I do not!&nbsp; Only see that
thou dust level the corn, and strike up some love-ditty in the
wench&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp; More pleasantly thus wilt thou
labour, and, indeed, of old thou wert a melodist.</p>
<p><i>Battus</i>.&nbsp; Ye Muses Pierian, sing ye with me the

make wholly fair.</p>

<p><i>They that thresh corn should shun the noon-day steep</i>;
<i>at noon the chaff parts easiest from the straw</i>.</p>
<p><i>As for the reapers</i>, <i>let them begin when the crested

<span class="GutSmall">THE CYCLOPS IN LOVE</span></h3>
<p><i>Nicias</i>, <i>the physician and poet</i>, <i>being in
love</i>, <i>Theocritus reminds him that in song lies the only
remedy</i>.&nbsp; <i>It was by song</i>, <i>he says</i>, <i>that
the Cyclops</i>, <i>Polyphemus</i>, <i>got him some ease</i>,
<i>when he was in love with Galatea</i>, <i>the
sea-nymph</i>.</p>
<p><i>The idyl displays</i>, <i>in the most graceful manner</i>,
<i>the Alexandrian taste for turning Greek mythology into love
stories</i>.&nbsp; <i>No creature could be more remote from love
than the original Polyphemus</i>, <i>the cannibal giant of the
Odyssey</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is none other medicine,
Nicias, against Love, neither unguent, methinks, nor salve to
sprinkle,&mdash;none, save the Muses of Pieria!&nbsp; Now a
delicate thing is their minstrelsy in man&rsquo;s life, and a
sweet, but hard to procure.&nbsp; Methinks thou know&rsquo;st
this well, who art thyself a leech, and beyond all men art
plainly dear to the Muses nine.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas surely thus the Cyclops fleeted his life most
easily, he that dwelt among us,&mdash;Polyphemus of old
time,&mdash;when the beard was yet young on his cheek and chin;
and he loved Galatea.&nbsp; He loved, not with apples, not roses,
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>nor locks
of hair, but with fatal frenzy, and all things else he held but
trifles by the way.&nbsp; Many a time from the green pastures
would his ewes stray back, self-shepherded, to the fold.&nbsp;
But he was singing of Galatea, and pining in his place he sat by
the sea-weed of the beach, from the dawn of day, with the direst
hurt beneath his breast of mighty Cypris&rsquo;s
sending,&mdash;the wound of her arrow in his heart!</p>
<p>Yet this remedy he found, and sitting on the crest of the tall
cliff, and looking to the deep, &rsquo;twas thus he would
sing:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Song of the Cyclops</i>.</p>
<p>O milk-white Galatea, why cast off him that loves thee?&nbsp;
More white than is pressed milk to look upon, more delicate than
the lamb art thou, than the young calf wantoner, more sleek than
the unripened grape!&nbsp; Here dust thou resort, even so, when
sweet sleep possesses me, and home straightway dost thou depart
when sweet sleep lets me go, fleeing me like an ewe that has seen
the grey wolf.</p>
<p>I fell in love with thee, maiden, I, on the day when first
thou camest, with my mother, and didst wish to pluck the
hyacinths from the hill, and I was thy guide on the way.&nbsp;
But to leave loving thee, when once I had seen thee, neither
afterward, nor now at all, have I the strength, even from that
hour.&nbsp; But to thee all this is as nothing, by Zeus, nay,
nothing at all!</p>
<p>I know, thou gracious maiden, why it is <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>that thou
dust shun me.&nbsp; It is all for the shaggy brow that spans all
my forehead, from this to the other ear, one long unbroken
eyebrow.&nbsp; And but one eye is on my forehead, and broad is
the nose that overhangs my lip.&nbsp; Yet I (even such as thou
seest me) feed a thousand cattle, and from these I draw and drink
the best milk in the world.&nbsp; And cheese I never lack, in
summer time or autumn, nay, nor in the dead of winter, but my
baskets are always overladen.</p>
<p>Also I am skilled in piping, as none other of the Cyclopes
here, and of thee, my love, my sweet-apple, and of myself too I
sing, many a time, deep in the night.&nbsp; And for thee I tend
eleven fawns, all crescent-browed, <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a> and four young
whelps of the bear.</p>
<p>Nay, come thou to me, and thou shalt lack nothing that now
thou hast.&nbsp; Leave the grey sea to roll against the land;
more sweetly, in this cavern, shalt thou fleet the night with
me!&nbsp; Thereby the laurels grow, and there the slender
cypresses, there is the ivy dun, and the sweet clustered grapes;
there is chill water, that for me deep-wooded &AElig;tna sends
down from the white snow, a draught divine!&nbsp; Ah who, in
place of these, would choose the sea to dwell in, or the waves of
the sea?</p>
<p>But if thou dust refuse because my body seems shaggy and
rough, well, I have faggots of oakwood, and beneath the ashes is
fire unwearied, and I would endure to let thee burn <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>my very soul,
and this my one eye, the dearest thing that is mine.</p>
<p>Ah me, that my mother bore me not a finny thing, so would I
have gone down to thee, and kissed thy hand, if thy lips thou
would not suffer me to kiss!&nbsp; And I would have brought thee
either white lilies, or the soft poppy with its scarlet
petals.&nbsp; Nay, these are summer&rsquo;s flowers, and those
are flowers of winter, so I could not have brought thee them all
at one time.</p>
<p>Now, verily, maiden, now and here will I learn to swim, if
perchance some stranger come hither, sailing with his ship, that
I may see why it is so dear to thee, to have thy dwelling in the
deep.</p>
<p>Come forth, Galatea, and forget as thou comest, even as I that
sit here have forgotten, the homeward way!&nbsp; Nay, choose with
me to go shepherding, with me to milk the flocks, and to pour the
sharp rennet in, and to fix the cheeses.</p>
<p>There is none that wrongs me but that mother of mine, and her
do I blame.&nbsp; Never, nay, never once has she spoken a kind
word for me to thee, and that though day by day she beholds me
wasting.&nbsp; I will tell her that my head, and both my feet are
throbbing, that she may somewhat suffer, since I too am
suffering.</p>
<p>O Cyclops, Cyclops, whither are thy wits wandering?&nbsp; Ah
that thou wouldst go, and weave thy wicker-work, and gather
broken <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>boughs to carry to thy lambs: in faith, if thou didst
this, far wiser wouldst thou be!</p>
<p>Milk the ewe that thou hast, why pursue the thing that shuns
thee?&nbsp; Thou wilt find, perchance, another, and a fairer
Galatea.&nbsp; Many be the girls that bid me play with them
through the night, and softly they all laugh, if perchance I
answer them.&nbsp; On land it is plain that I too seem to be
somebody!</p>

<p>Lo, thus Polyphemus still shepherded his love with song, and
lived lighter than if he had given gold for ease.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE PASSIONATE FRIEND</span></h3>
<p><i>This is rather a lyric than an idyl</i>, <i>being an
expression of that singular passion which existed between men in
historical Greece</i>.&nbsp; <i>The next idyl</i>, <i>like the
Myrmidons of Aeschylus</i>, <i>attributes the same manners to
mythical and heroic Greece</i>.&nbsp; <i>It should be unnecessary
to say that the affection between Homeric warriors</i>, <i>like
Achilles and Patroclus</i>, <i>was only that of companions in
arms and was quite unlike the later sentiment</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Hast</span> thou come, dear youth, with
the third night and the dawning; hast thou come? but men in
longing grow old in a day!&nbsp; As spring than the winter is
sweeter, as the apple than the sloe, as the ewe is deeper of
fleece than the lamb she bore; as a maiden surpasses a
thrice-wedded wife, as the fawn is nimbler than the calf; nay, by
as much as sweetest of all fowls sings the clear-voiced
nightingale, so much has thy coming gladdened me!&nbsp; To thee
have I hastened as the traveller hastens under the burning sun to
the shadow of the ilex tree.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Ah,
would that equally the Loves may breathe upon us twain, may we
become a song in the ears of all men unborn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lo, a pair were these two friends among the folk of
former time,&rsquo; the one &lsquo;the Knight&rsquo; (so the
Amyclaeans call him), the other, again, &lsquo;the Page,&rsquo;
so styled in speech of Thessaly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An equal yoke of friendship they bore: ah, surely then
there were golden men of old, when friends gave love for
love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And would, O father Cronides, and would, ye ageless immortals,
that this might be; and that when two hundred generations have
sped, one might bring these tidings to me by Acheron, the
irremeable stream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The loving-kindness that was between thee and thy
gracious friend, is even now in all men&rsquo;s mouths, and
chiefly on the lips of the young.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nay, verily, the gods of heaven will be masters of these
things, to rule them as they will, but when I praise thy
graciousness no blotch that punishes the perjurer shall spring
upon the tip of my nose!&nbsp; Nay, if ever thou hast somewhat
pained me, forthwith thou healest the hurt, giving a double
delight, and I depart with my cup full and running over!</p>
<p>Nisaean men of Megara, ye champions of the oars, happily may
ye dwell, for that ye honoured above all men the Athenian
stranger, even Diodes, the true lover.&nbsp; Always about his
tomb the children gather in their companies, at the coming in of
the spring, and contend for <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the prize of kissing.&nbsp; And whoso
most sweetly touches lip to lip, laden with garlands he returneth
to his mother.&nbsp; Happy is he that judges those kisses of the
children; surely he prays most earnestly to bright-faced
Ganymedes, that his lips may be as the Lydian touchstone
wherewith the money-changers try gold lest perchance base metal
pass for true.</p>
<h3><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>IDYL
XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HYLAS AND HERACLES</span></h3>
<p><i>As in the eleventh Idyl</i>, <i>Nicias is again
addressed</i>, <i>by way of introduction to the story of
Hylas</i>.&nbsp; <i>This beautiful lad</i>, <i>a favourite
companion of Heracles</i>, <i>took part in the Quest of the
Fleece of Gold</i>.&nbsp; <i>As he went to draw water from a
fountain</i>, <i>the water-nymphs dragged him down to their
home</i>, <i>and Heracles</i>, <i>after a long and vain
search</i>, <i>was compelled to follow the heroes of the Quest on
foot to Phasis</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> for us only, Nicias, as we were
used to deem, was Love begotten, by whomsoever of the Gods was
the father of the child; not first to us seemed beauty beautiful,
to us that are mortal men and look not on the morrow.&nbsp; Nay,
but the son of Amphitryon, that heart of bronze, who abode the
wild lion&rsquo;s onset, loved a lad, beautiful Hylas&mdash;Hylas
of the braided locks, and he taught him all things as a father
teaches his child, all whereby himself became a mighty man, and
renowned in minstrelsy.&nbsp; Never was he apart from Hylas, not
when midnoon was high in heaven, not when Dawn with her white <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>horses speeds
upwards to the dwelling of Zeus, not when the twittering
nestlings look towards the perch, while their mother flaps her
wings above the smoke-browned beam; and all this that the lad
might be fashioned to his mind, and might drive a straight
furrow, and come to the true measure of man.</p>
<p>But when Iason, Aeson&rsquo;s son, was sailing after the
fleece of gold (and with him followed the champions, the first
chosen out of all the cities, they that were of most avail), to
rich Iolcos too came the mighty man and adventurous, the son of
the woman of Midea, noble Alcmene.&nbsp; With him went down Hylas
also, to Argo of the goodly benches, the ship that grazed not on
the clashing rocks Cyanean, but through she sped and ran into
deep Phasis, as an eagle over the mighty gulf of the sea.&nbsp;
And the clashing rocks stand fixed, even from that hour!</p>
<p>Now at the rising of the Pleiades, when the upland fields
begin to pasture the young lambs, and when spring is already on
the wane, then the flower divine of Heroes bethought them of
sea-faring.&nbsp; On board the hollow Argo they sat down to the
oars, and to the Hellespont they came when the south wind had
been for three days blowing, and made their haven within
Propontis, where the oxen of the Cianes wear bright the
ploughshare, as they widen the furrows.&nbsp; Then they went
forth upon the shore, and each couple busily got ready supper in
the late evening, and many as they were one bed <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>they strewed
lowly on the ground, for they found a meadow lying, rich in
couches of strown grass and leaves.&nbsp; Thence they cut them
pointed flag-leaves, and deep marsh-galingale.&nbsp; And Hylas of
the yellow hair, with a vessel of bronze in his hand, went to
draw water against suppertime, for Heracles himself, and the
steadfast Telamon, for these comrades twain supped ever at one
table.&nbsp; Soon was he ware of a spring, in a hollow land, and
the rushes grew thickly round it, and dark swallow-wort, and
green maiden-hair, and blooming parsley, and deer-grass spreading
through the marshy land.&nbsp; In the midst of the water the
nymphs were arraying their dances, the sleepless nymphs, dread
goddesses of the country people, Eunice, and Malis, and Nycheia,
with her April eyes.&nbsp; And now the boy was holding out the
wide-mouthed pitcher to the water, intent on dipping it, but the
nymphs all clung to his hand, for love of the Argive lad had
fluttered the soft hearts of all of them.&nbsp; Then down he sank
into the black water, headlong all, as when a star shoots flaming
from the sky, plumb in the deep it falls, and a mate shouts out
to the seamen, &lsquo;Up with the gear, my lads, the wind is fair
for sailing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the nymphs held the weeping boy on their laps, and with
gentle words were striving to comfort him.&nbsp; But the son of
Amphitryon was troubled about the lad, and went forth, carrying
his bended bow in Scythian fashion, and the club that is ever
grasped in his right <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>hand.&nbsp; Thrice he shouted
&lsquo;Hylas!&rsquo; as loud as his deep throat could call, and
thrice again the boy heard him, and thin came his voice from the
water, and, hard by though he was, he seemed very far away.&nbsp;
And as when a bearded lion, a ravening lion on the hills, hears
the bleating of a fawn afar off, and rushes forth from his lair
to seize it, his readiest meal, even so the mighty Heracles, in
longing for the lad, sped through the trackless briars, and
ranged over much country.</p>
<p>Reckless are lovers: great toils did Heracles bear, in hills
and thickets wandering, and Iason&rsquo;s quest was all postponed
to this.&nbsp; Now the ship abode with her tackling aloft, and
the company gathered there, <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a> but at midnight the
young men were lowering the sails again, awaiting Heracles.&nbsp;
But he wheresoever his feet might lead him went wandering in his
fury, for the cruel Goddess of love was rending his heart within
him.</p>
<p>Thus loveliest Hylas is numbered with the Blessed, but for a
runaway they girded at Heracles, the heroes, because he roamed
from Argo of the sixty oarsmen.&nbsp; But on foot he came to
Colchis and inhospitable Phasis.</p>

<p><i>This Idyl</i>, <i>like the next</i>, <i>is dramatic in
form</i>.&nbsp; <i>One Aeschines tells Thyonichus the story of
his quarrel with his mistress Cynisca</i>.&nbsp; <i>He speaks of
taking foreign service</i>, <i>and Thyonichus recommends that of
Ptolemy</i>.&nbsp; <i>The idyl was probably written at
Alexandria</i>, <i>as a compliment to Ptolemy</i>, <i>and an
inducement to Greeks to join his forces</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is
nothing</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>to fix the date</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; All hail to the stout Thyonichus!</p>
<p><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; As much to you, Aeschines.</p>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; How long it is since we met!</p>
<p><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; Is it so long?&nbsp; But why, pray,
this melancholy?</p>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; I am not in the best of luck,
Thyonichus.</p>
<p><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for that, then, you are so
lean, and hence comes this long moustache, and these love-locks
all adust.&nbsp; Just such a figure was a Pythagorean that came
here of late, barefoot and wan,&mdash;and said he was an
Athenian.&nbsp; Marry, he too was in love, methinks, with a plate
of pancakes.</p>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; Friend, you will always have your <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>jest,&mdash;but beautiful Cynisca,&mdash;she flouts
me!&nbsp; I shall go mad some day, when no man looks for it; I am
but a hair&rsquo;s-breadth on the hither side, even now.</p>
<p><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; You are ever like this, dear
Aeschines, now mad, now sad, and crying for all things at your
whim.&nbsp; Yet, tell me, what is your new trouble?</p>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; The Argive, and I, and the Thessalian
rough rider, Apis, and Cleunichus the free lance, were drinking
together, at my farm.&nbsp; I had killed two chickens, and a
sucking pig, and had opened the Bibline wine for
them,&mdash;nearly four years old,&mdash;but fragrant as when it
left the wine-press.&nbsp; Truffles and shellfish had been
brought out, it was a jolly drinking match.&nbsp; And when things
were now getting forwarder, we determined that each of us should
toast whom he pleased, in unmixed wine, only he must name his
toast.&nbsp; So we all drank, and called our toasts as had been
agreed.&nbsp; Yet She said nothing, though I was there; how think
you I liked that?&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you call a
toast?&nbsp; You have seen the wolf!&rsquo; some one said in
jest, &lsquo;as the proverb goes,&rsquo; <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> then she kindled; yes, you could easily
have <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>lighted a lamp at her face.&nbsp; There is one Wolf, one
Wolf there is, the son of Labes our neighbour,&mdash;he is tall,
smooth-skinned, many think him handsome.&nbsp; His was that
illustrious love in which she was pining, yes, and a breath about
the business once came secretly to my ears, but I never looked
into it, beshrew my beard!</p>
<p>Already, mark you, we four men were deep in our cups, when the
Larissa man out of mere mischief, struck up, &lsquo;My
Wolf,&rsquo; some Thessalian catch, from the very
beginning.&nbsp; Then Cynisca suddenly broke out weeping more
bitterly than a six-year-old maid, that longs for her
mother&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; Then I,&mdash;you know me,
Thyonichus,&mdash;struck her on the cheek with clenched
fist,&mdash;one two!&nbsp; She caught up her robes, and forth she
rushed, quicker than she came.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, my undoing&rsquo;
(cried I), &lsquo;I am not good enough for you, then&mdash;you
have a dearer playfellow? well, be off and cherish your other
lover, &rsquo;tis for him your tears run big as apples!&rsquo; <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>And as the swallow flies swiftly back to gather a morsel,
fresh food, for her young ones under the eaves, still swifter
sped she from her soft chair, straight through the vestibule and
folding-doors, wherever her feet carried her.&nbsp; So, sure, the
old proverb says, &lsquo;the bull has sought the wild
wood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since then there are twenty days, and eight <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>to these, and
nine again, then ten others, to-day is the eleventh, add two
more, and it is two months since we parted, and I have not
shaved, not even in Thracian fashion. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a></p>
<p>And now Wolf is everything with her.&nbsp; Wolf finds the door
open o&rsquo; nights, and I am of no account, not in the
reckoning, like the wretched men of Megara, in the place
dishonourable. <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a></p>
<p>And if I could cease to love, the world would wag as well as
may be.&nbsp; But now,&mdash;now,&mdash;as they say, Thyonichus,
I am like the mouse that has tasted pitch.&nbsp; And what remedy
there may be for a bootless love, I know not; except that Simus,
he who was in love with the daughter of Epicalchus, went over
seas, and came back heart-whole,&mdash;a man of my own age.&nbsp;
And I too will cross the water, and prove not the first, maybe,
nor the last, perhaps, but a fair soldier as times go.</p>
<p><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; Would that things had gone to your
mind, Aeschines.&nbsp; But if, in good earnest, you are thus set
on going into exile, <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span> is the
free man&rsquo;s best paymaster!</p>
<p><i>Aeschines</i>.&nbsp; And in other respects, what kind of
man?</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span><i>Thyonichus</i>.&nbsp; The free man&rsquo;s best
paymaster!&nbsp; Indulgent too, the Muses&rsquo; darling, a true
lover, the top of good company, knows his friends, and still
better knows his enemies.&nbsp; A great giver to many, refuses
nothing that he is asked which to give may beseem a king, but,
Aeschines, we should not always be asking.&nbsp; Thus, if you are
minded to pin up the top corner of your cloak over the right
shoulder, and if you have the heart to stand steady on both feet,
and bide the brunt of a hardy targeteer, off instantly to
Egypt!&nbsp; From the temples downward we all wax grey, and on to
the chin creeps the rime of age, men must do somewhat while their
knees are yet nimble.</p>

<p><i>Praxino&euml;</i>.&nbsp; Lady Athene, what spinning women
wrought them, what painters designed these drawings, so true they

Do you pretend to command ladies of Syracuse?&nbsp; If you must

Doric, I presume?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Psalm of Adonis</i>.</p>
<p>O Queen that lovest Golgi, and Idalium, and the steep of Eryx,
O Aphrodite, that playest with gold, lo, from the stream eternal
of Acheron they have brought back to thee Adonis&mdash;even in
the twelfth month they have brought him, the dainty-footed
Hours.&nbsp; Tardiest of the Immortals are the beloved Hours, but
dear and desired they come, for always, to all mortals, they
bring some gift with them.&nbsp; O Cypris, daughter of
Di&ocirc;n&ecirc;, from mortal to immortal, so men tell, thou
hast changed Berenice, dropping softly in the woman&rsquo;s
breast the stuff of immortality.</p>
<p>Therefore, for thy delight, O thou of many names and many
temples, doth the daughter of Berenice, even Arsino&euml;, lovely
as Helen, cherish Adonis with all things beautiful.</p>
<p>Before him lie all ripe fruits that the tall trees&rsquo;
branches bear, and the delicate gardens, arrayed in baskets of
silver, and the golden vessels are full of incense of
Syria.&nbsp; And all the dainty cakes that women fashion in the
kneading-tray, mingling blossoms manifold with the white wheaten
flour, all that is wrought of honey sweet, and in soft olive oil,
all cakes fashioned in the semblance of things that fly, <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and of things
that creep, lo, here they are set before him.</p>
<p>Here are built for him shadowy bowers of green, all laden with
tender anise, and children flit overhead&mdash;the little
Loves&mdash;as the young nightingales perched upon the trees fly
forth and try their wings from bough to bough.</p>
<p>O the ebony, O the gold, O the twin eagles of white ivory that
carry to Zeus the son of Cronos his darling, his
cup-bearer!&nbsp; O the purple coverlet strewn above, more soft
than sleep!&nbsp; So Miletus will say, and whoso feeds sheep in
Samos.</p>
<p>Another bed is strewn for beautiful Adonis, one bed Cypris
keeps, and one the rosy-armed Adonis.&nbsp; A bridegroom of
eighteen or nineteen years is he, his kisses are not rough, the
golden down being yet upon his lips!&nbsp; And now, good-night to
Cypris, in the arms of her lover!&nbsp; But lo, in the morning we
will all of us gather with the dew, and carry him forth among the
waves that break upon the beach, and with locks unloosed, and
ungirt raiment falling to the ankles, and bosoms bare will we
begin our shrill sweet song.</p>
<p>Thou only, dear Adonis, so men tell, thou only of the demigods
dost visit both this world and the stream of Acheron.&nbsp; For
Agamemnon had no such lot, nor Aias, that mighty lord of the
terrible anger, nor Hector, the eldest born of the twenty sons of
Hecabe, nor Patroclus, nor Pyrrhus, that returned out of
Troyland, nor the heroes of yet more ancient days, the <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Lapithae and
Deucalion&rsquo;s sons, nor the sons of Pelops, and the chiefs of
Pelasgian Argus.&nbsp; Be gracious now, dear Adonis, and
propitious even in the coming year.&nbsp; Dear to us has thine
advent been, Adonis, and dear shall it be when thou comest
again.</p>
<p><i>Gorgo</i>.&nbsp; Praxino&euml;, the woman is cleverer than
we fancied!&nbsp; Happy woman to know so much, thrice happy to
have so sweet a voice.&nbsp; Well, all the same, it is time to be
making for home.&nbsp; Diocleides has not had his dinner, and the
man is all vinegar,&mdash;don&rsquo;t venture near him when he is
kept waiting for dinner.&nbsp; Farewell, beloved Adonis, may you
find us glad at your next coming!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> is this the care of the
maidens of Zeus, ever the care of minstrels, to sing the
Immortals, to sing the praises of noble men.&nbsp; The Muses, lo,
are Goddesses, of Gods the Goddesses sing, but we on earth are
mortal men; let us mortals sing of mortals.&nbsp; Ah, who of all
them that dwell beneath the grey morning, will open his door and
gladly receive our Graces within his house? who is there that
will not send them back again without a gift?&nbsp; And <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>they with
looks askance, and naked feet come homewards, and sorely they
upbraid me when they have gone on a vain journey, and listless
again in the bottom of their empty coffer, they dwell with heads
bowed over their chilly knees, where is their drear abode, when
gainless they return.</p>
<p>Where is there such an one, among men to-day?&nbsp; Where is
he that will befriend him that speaks his praises?&nbsp; I know
not, for now no longer, as of old, are men eager to win the
renown of noble deeds, nay, they are the slaves of gain!&nbsp;
Each man clasps his hands below the purse-fold of his gown, and
looks about to spy whence he may get him money: the very rust is
too precious to be rubbed off for a gift.&nbsp; Nay, each has his
ready saw; <i>the shin is further than the knee</i>; <i>first let
me get my own</i>!&nbsp; <i>&rsquo;Tis the Gods&rsquo; affair to
honour minstrels</i>!&nbsp; <i>Homer is enough for every one</i>,
<i>who wants to hear any other</i>?&nbsp; <i>He is the best of
bards who takes nothing that is mine</i>.</p>
<p>O foolish men, in the store of gold uncounted, what gain have
ye?&nbsp; Not in this do the wise find the true enjoyment of
wealth, but in that they can indulge their own desires, and
something bestow on one of the minstrels, and do good deeds to
many of their kin, and to many another man; and always give
altar-rites to the Gods, nor ever play the churlish host, but
kindly entreat the guest at table, and speed him when he would be
gone.&nbsp; And this, above all, to honour the holy interpreters
of the <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Muses, that so thou mayest have a goodly fame, even when
hidden in Hades, nor ever moan without renown by the chill water
of Acheron, like one whose palms the spade has hardened, some
landless man bewailing the poverty that is all his heritage.</p>
<p>Many were the thralls that in the palace of Antiochus, and of
king Aleuas drew out their monthly dole, many the calves that
were driven to the penns of the Scopiadae, and lowed with the
horned kine: countless on the Crannonian plain did shepherds
pasture beneath the sky the choicest sheep of the hospitable
Creondae, yet from all this they had no joy, when once into the
wide raft of hateful Acheron they had breathed sweet life
away!&nbsp; Yea, unremembered (though they had left all that rich
store), for ages long would they have lain among the dead
forlorn, if a name among later men the skilled Ceian minstrel had
spared to bestow, singing his bright songs to a harp of many
strings.&nbsp; Honour too was won by the swift steeds that came
home to them crowned from the sacred contests.</p>
<p>And who would ever have known the Lycian champions of time
past, who Priam&rsquo;s long-haired sons, and Cycnus, white of
skin as a maiden, if minstrels had not chanted of the war cries
of the old heroes?&nbsp; Nor would Odysseus have won his lasting
glory, for all his ten years wandering among all folks; and
despite the visit he paid, he a living man, to inmost Hades, and
for all his escape from the murderous <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Cyclops&rsquo;s cave,&mdash;unheard
too were the names of the swineherd Eumaeus, and of Philoetius,
busy with the kine of the herds; yea, and even of Laertes, high
of heart; if the songs of the Ionian man had not kept them in
renown.</p>
<p>From the Muses comes a goodly report to men, but the living
heirs devour the possessions of the dead.&nbsp; But, lo, it is as
light labour to count the waves upon the beach, as many as wind
and grey sea-tide roll upon the shore, or in violet-hued water to
cleanse away the stain from a potsherd, as to win favour from a
man that is smitten with the greed of gain.&nbsp; Good-day to
such an one, and countless be his coin, and ever may he be
possessed by a longing desire for more!&nbsp; But I for my part
would choose honour and the loving-kindness of men, far before
wealth in mules and horses.</p>
<p>I am seeking to what mortal I may come, a welcome guest, with
the help of the Muses, for hard indeed do minstrels find the
ways, who go uncompanioned by the daughters of deep-counselling
Zeus.&nbsp; Not yet is the heaven aweary of rolling the months
onwards, and the years, and many a horse shall yet whirl the
chariot wheels, and the man shall yet be found, who will take me
for his minstrel; a man of deeds like those that great Achilles
wrought, or puissant Aias, in the plain of Simois, where is the
tomb of Phrygian Ilus.</p>
<p>Even now the Phoenicians that dwell beneath the setting sun on
the spur of Libya, shudder for dread, even now the Syracusans <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>poise lances
in rest, and their arms are burdened by the linden shields.&nbsp;
Among them Hiero, like the mighty men of old, girds himself for
fight, and the horse-hair crest is shadowing his helmet.&nbsp;
Ah, Zeus, our father renowned, and ah, lady Athene, and O thou
Maiden that with the Mother dost possess the great burg of the
rich Ephyreans, by the water of Lusimeleia, <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> would that dire necessity may drive our
foemen from the isle, along the Sardinian wave, to tell the doom
of their friends to children and to wives&mdash;messengers easy
to number out of so many warriors!&nbsp; But as for our cities
may they again be held by their ancient masters,&mdash;all the
cities that hostile hands have utterly spoiled.&nbsp; May our
people till the flowering fields, and may thousands of sheep
unnumbered fatten &rsquo;mid the herbage, and bleat along the
plain, while the kine as they come in droves to the stalls warn
the belated traveller to hasten on his way.&nbsp; May the fallows
be broken for the seed-time, while the cicala, watching the
shepherds as they toil in the sun, in the shade of the trees doth
sing on the topmost sprays.&nbsp; May spiders weave their
delicate webs over martial gear, may none any more so much as
name the cry of onset!</p>
<p>But the fame of Hiero may minstrels bear aloft, across the
Scythian sea, and where Semiramis reigned, that built the mighty
wall, <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and
made it fast with slime for mortar.&nbsp; I am but one of many
that are loved by the daughters of Zeus, and they all are fain to
sing of Sicilian Arethusa, with the people of the isle, and the
warrior Hiero.&nbsp; O Graces, ye Goddesses, adored of Eteocles,
ye that love Orchomenos of the Minyae, the ancient enemy of
Thebes, when no man bids me, let me abide at home, but to the
houses of such as bid me, boldly let me come with my Muses.&nbsp;
Nay, neither the Muses nor you Graces will I leave behind, for
without the Graces what have men that is desirable? with the
Graces of song may I dwell for ever!</p>

<p><i>The poet praises Ptolemy Philadelphus in a strain of almost
religious adoration</i>.&nbsp; <i>Hauler</i>, <i>in his Life of
Theocritus</i>, <i>dates the poem about</i> 259 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>, <i>but it may have been many years
earlier</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Zeus let us begin, and with
Zeus make end, ye Muses, whensoever we chant in songs the
chiefest of immortals!&nbsp; But of men, again, let Ptolemy be
named, among the foremost, and last, and in the midmost place,
for of men he hath the pre-eminence.&nbsp; The heroes that in old
days were begotten of the demigods, wrought noble deeds, and
chanced on minstrels skilled, but I, with what skill I have in
song, would fain make my hymn of Ptolemy, and hymns are the
glorious meed, yea, of the very immortals.</p>
<p>When the feller hath come up to wooded Ida, he glances around,
so many are the trees, to see whence he should begin his
labour.&nbsp; Where first shall <i>I</i> begin the tale, for
there are countless things ready for the telling, wherewith the
Gods have graced the most excellent of kings?</p>
<p>Even by virtue of his sires, how mighty was he to accomplish
some great work,&mdash;Ptolemy <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>son of Lagus,&mdash;when he had
stored in his mind such a design, as no other man was able even
to devise!&nbsp; Him hath the Father stablished in the same
honour as the blessed immortals, and for him a golden mansion in
the house of Zeus is builded; beside him is throned Alexander,
that dearly loves him, Alexander, a grievous god to the
white-turbaned Persians.</p>
<p>And over against them is set the throne of Heracles, the
slayer of the Bull, wrought of stubborn adamant.&nbsp; There
holds he festival with the rest of the heavenly host, rejoicing
exceedingly in his far-off children&rsquo;s children, for that
the son of Cronos hath taken old age clean away from their limbs,
and they are called immortals, being his offspring.&nbsp; For the
strong son of Heracles is ancestor of the twain, I and both are
reckoned to Heracles, on the utmost of the lineage.</p>
<p>Therefore when he hath now had his fill of fragrant nectar,
and is going from the feast to the bower of his bed-fellow dear,
to one of his children he gives his bow, and the quiver that
swings beneath his elbow, to the other his knotted mace of
iron.&nbsp; Then they to the ambrosial bower of white-ankled
Hera, convey the weapons and the bearded son of Zeus.</p>
<p>Again, how shone renowned Berenice among the wise of
womankind, how great a boon was she to them that begat her!&nbsp;
Yea, in her fragrant breast did the Lady of Cyprus, the queenly
daughter of Dione, lay her slender hands, wherefore they say that
never any <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>woman brought man such delight as came from the love
borne to his wife by Ptolemy.&nbsp; And verily he was loved again
with far greater love, and in such a wedlock a man may well trust
all his house to his children, whensoever he goes to the bed of
one that loves him as he loves her.&nbsp; But the mind of a woman
that loves not is set ever on a stranger, and she hath children
at her desire, but they are never like the father.</p>
<p>O thou that amongst the Goddesses hast the prize of beauty, O
Lady Aphrodite, thy care was she, and by thy favour the lovely
Berenice crossed not Acheron, the river of mourning, but thou
didst catch her away, ere she came to the dark water, and to the
still-detested ferryman of souls outworn, and in thy temple didst
thou instal her, and gavest her a share of thy worship.&nbsp;
Kindly is she to all mortals, and she breathes into them soft
desires, and she lightens the cares of him that is in
longing.</p>
<p>O dark-browed lady of Argos, <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a> in wedlock with
Tydeus didst thou bear slaying Diomede, a hero of Calydon, and,
again, deep-bosomed Thetis to Peleus, son of Aeacus, bare the
spearman Achilles.&nbsp; But thee, O warrior Ptolemy, to Ptolemy
the warrior bare the glorious Berenice!&nbsp; And Cos did foster
thee, when thou wert still a child new-born, and received thee at
thy mother&rsquo;s hand, when thou saw&rsquo;st thy first
dawning.&nbsp; For there she called aloud on Eilithyia, loosener
of the girdle; she called, <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the daughter of Antigone, when heavy
on her came the pangs of childbirth.&nbsp; And Eilithyia was
present to help her, and so poured over all her limbs release
from pain.&nbsp; Then the beloved child was born, his
father&rsquo;s very counterpart.&nbsp; And Cos brake forth into a
cry, when she beheld it, and touching the child with kind hands,
she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blessed, O child, mayst thou be, and me mayst thou
honour even as Phoebus Apollo honours Delos of the azure crown,
yea, stablish in the same renown the Triopean hill, and allot
such glory to the Dorians dwelling nigh, as that wherewithal
Prince Apollo favours Rhenaea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lo, thus spake the Isle, but far aloft under the clouds a
great eagle screamed thrice aloud, the ominous bird of
Zeus.&nbsp; This sign, methinks, was of Zeus; Zeus, the son of
Cronos, in his care hath awful kings, but he is above all, whom
Zeus loved from the first, even from his birth.&nbsp; Great
fortune goes with him, and much land he rules, and wide sea.</p>
<p>Countless are the lands, and tribes of men innumerable win
increase of the soil that waxeth under the rain of Zeus, but no
land brings forth so much as low-lying Egypt, when Nile wells up
and breaks the sodden soil.&nbsp; Nor is there any land that hath
so many towns of men skilled in handiwork; therein are three
centuries of cities builded, and thousands three, and to these
three myriads, and cities twice three, and beside these, three
times nine, and over them all high-hearted Ptolemy is king.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Yea,
and he taketh him a portion of Phoenicia, and of Arabia, and of
Syria, and of Libya, and the black Aethiopians.&nbsp; And he is
lord of all the Pamphylians, and the Cilician warriors, and the
Lycians, and the Carians, that joy in battle, and lord of the
isles of the Cyclades,&mdash;since his are the best of ships that
sail over the deep,&mdash;yea, all the sea, and land and the
sounding rivers are ruled by Ptolemy.&nbsp; Many are his
horsemen, and many his targeteers that go clanging in harness of
shining bronze.&nbsp; And in weight of wealth he surpasses all
kings; such treasure comes day by day from every side to his rich
palace, while the people are busy about their labours in
peace.&nbsp; For never hath a foeman marched up the bank of
teaming Nile, and raised the cry of war in villages not his own,
nor hath any cuirassed enemy leaped ashore from his swift ship,
to harry the kine of Egypt.&nbsp; So mighty a hero hath his
throne established in the broad plains, even Ptolemy of the fair
hair, a spearman skilled, whose care is above all, as a good
king&rsquo;s should be, to keep all the heritage of his fathers,
and yet more he himself doth win.&nbsp; Nay, nor useless in
<i>his</i> wealthy house, is the gold, like piled stores of the
still toilsome ants, but the glorious temples of the gods have
their rich share, for constant first-fruits he renders, with many
another due, and much is lavished on mighty kings, much on
cities, much on faithful friends.&nbsp; And never to the sacred
contests of Dionysus comes any man that is skilled to raise the
shrill <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>sweet song, but Ptolemy gives him a guerdon worthy of
his art.&nbsp; And the interpreters of the Muses sing of Ptolemy,
in return for his favours.&nbsp; Nay, what fairer thing might
befall a wealthy man, than to win a goodly renown among
mortals?</p>
<p>This abides even by the sons of Atreus, but all those
countless treasures that they won, when they took the mighty
house of Priam, are hidden away in the mist, whence there is no
returning.</p>
<p>Ptolemy alone presses his own feet in the footmarks, yet
glowing in the dust, of his fathers that were before him.&nbsp;
To his mother dear, and his father he hath stablished fragrant
temples; therein has he set their images, splendid with gold and
ivory, to succour all earthly men.&nbsp; And many fat thighs of
kine doth he burn on the empurpled altars, as the months roll by,
he and his stately wife; no nobler lady did ever embrace a
bridegroom in the halls, who loves, with her whole heart, her
brother, her lord.&nbsp; On this wise was the holy bridal of the
Immortals, too, accomplished, even of the pair that great Rhea
bore, the rulers of Olympus; and one bed for the slumber of Zeus
and of Hera doth Iris strew, with myrrh-anointed hands, the
virgin Iris.</p>
<p>Prince Ptolemy, farewell, and of thee will I make mention,
even as of the other demigods; and a word methinks I will utter
not to be rejected of men yet unborn,&mdash;excellence, howbeit,
thou shalt gain from Zeus.</p>

limbs heavy with slumber, or art thou all too fond of sleep, or
hadst thou perchance drunken over well, ere thou didst <a

thy rest?&nbsp; Thou shouldst have slept betimes, and alone, if
thou wert so fain of sleep; thou shouldst have left the maiden
with maidens beside her mother dear, to play till deep in the
dawn, for to-morrow, and next day, and for all the years,
Menelaus, she is thy bride.</p>
<p>O happy bridegroom, some good spirit sneezed out on thee a
blessing, as thou wert approaching Sparta whither went the other
princes, that so thou mightst win thy desire!&nbsp; Alone among
the demigods shalt thou have Zeus for father!&nbsp; Yea, and the
daughter of Zeus has come beneath one coverlet with thee, so fair
a lady, peerless among all Achaean women that walk the
earth.&nbsp; Surely a wondrous child would she bear thee, if she
bore one like the mother!</p>
<p>For lo, we maidens are all of like age with her, and one
course we were wont to run, anointed in manly fashion, by the
baths of Eurotas.&nbsp; Four times sixty girls were we, the
maiden flower of the land, <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a> but of us all not
one was faultless, when matched with Helen.</p>
<p>As the rising Dawn shows forth her fairer face than thine, O
Night, or as the bright Spring, when Winter relaxes his hold,
even so amongst us still she shone, the golden Helen.&nbsp; Even
as the crops spring up, the glory of the rich plough land; or, as
is the cypress in the garden; or, in a chariot, a horse of
Thessalian <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Lacedaemon.&nbsp; No other in her basket of wool winds forth such
goodly work, and none cuts out, from between the mighty beams, a
closer warp than that her shuttle weaves in the carven
loom.&nbsp; Yea, and of a truth none other smites the lyre,
hymning Artemis and broad-breasted Athene, with such skill as
Helen, within whose eyes dwell all the Loves.</p>
<p>O fair, O gracious damsel, even now art thou a wedded wife;
but we will go forth right early to the course we ran, and to the
grassy meadows, to gather sweet-breathing coronals of flowers,
thinking often upon thee, Helen, even as youngling lambs that
miss the teats of the mother-ewe.&nbsp; For thee first will we
twine a wreath of lotus flowers that lowly grow, and hang it on a
shadowy plane tree, for thee first will we take soft oil from the
silver phial, and drop it beneath a shadowy plane tree, and
letters will we grave on the bark, in Dorian wise, so that the
wayfarer may read:</p>

give you the blessing of children; and may Cypris, divine Cypris,
grant you equal love, to cherish each the other; and may Zeus,

hope to kiss my lovely mouth, nay, not even in a dream.&nbsp; How
thou dost look, what chatter is thine, how countrified thy tricks
are, how delicate thy talk, how easy thy tattle!&nbsp; And then
thy beard&mdash;so soft! thy elegant hair!&nbsp; Why, thy lips
are like some sick man&rsquo;s, thy hands are black, and thou art
of evil savour.&nbsp; Away with thee, lest thy presence soil

breast of her gown, and stared at me all over from head to feet;
shooting out her lips, and glancing with half-shut eyes, writhing

the sting, as a rose with dew.&nbsp; And she went off and left
me, but I bear angry pride deep in my heart, that I, the handsome
shepherd, should have been mocked by a wretched
light-o&rsquo;-love.</p>
<p>Shepherds, tell me the very truth; am I not beautiful?&nbsp;
Has some God changed me suddenly to another man?&nbsp; Surely a
sweet grace ever blossomed round me, till this hour, like ivy
round a tree, and covered my chin, and about my temples fell my
locks, like curling parsley-leaves, and white shone my forehead
above my dark eyebrows.&nbsp; Mine eyes were brighter far than
the glance of the grey-eyed Athene, my mouth than even pressed
milk was sweeter, and from my lips my voice flowed sweeter than
honey from the honeycomb.&nbsp; Sweet too, is my music, whether I
make melody on pipe, or discourse on the flute, or reed, or
flageolet.&nbsp; And all the mountain-maidens call me beautiful,
and they would kiss me, all of them.&nbsp; But the city girl did
not kiss me, but ran past me, because I am a neatherd, and she
never heard how fair Dionysus in the dells doth drive the calves,
and knows not that Cypris was wild with love for a herdsman, and
drove afield in the mountains of Phrygia; ay, and Adonis
himself,&mdash;in the oakwood she kissed, in the oakwood she
bewailed him.&nbsp; And what was Endymion? was he not a neatherd?
whom nevertheless as he watched his <a name="page104"></a><span

Olympus descending she came to the Latmian glade, and lay in one
couch with the boy; and thou, Rhea, dust weep for thy
herdsman.</p>
<p>And didst not thou, too, Son of Cronos, take the shape of a
wandering bird, and all for a cowherd boy?</p>
<p>But Eunica alone would not kiss the herdsman; Eunica, she that
is greater than Cybele, and Cypris, and Selene!</p>
<p>Well, Cypris, never mayst thou, in city or on hillside, kiss

<p><i>After some verses addressed to Diophantus</i>, <i>a friend
about whom nothing is known</i>, <i>the poet describes the
toilsome life of two old fishermen</i>.&nbsp; <i>One of them has
dreamed of catching a golden fish</i>, <i>and has sworn</i>,

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> Poverty alone,
Diophantus, that awakens the arts; Poverty, the very teacher of
labour.&nbsp; Nay, not even sleep is permitted, by weary cares,
to men that live by toil, and if, for a little while, one close
his eyes <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a> in the night, cares throng about him,
and suddenly disquiet his slumber.</p>
<p>Two fishers, on a time, two old men, together lay and slept;
they had strown the dry sea-moss for a bed in their wattled
cabin, and there they lay against the leafy wall.&nbsp; Beside
them were strewn the instruments of their toilsome hands, the
fishing-creels, the rods of reed, the hooks, the sails bedraggled
with sea-spoil, <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a> <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the lines,
the weds, the lobster pots woven of rushes, the seines, two oars,
<a name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b"
class="citation">[106b]</a> and an old coble upon props.&nbsp;
Beneath their heads was a scanty matting, their clothes, their
sailor&rsquo;s caps.&nbsp; Here was all their toil, here all
their wealth.&nbsp; The threshold had never a door, nor a
watch-dog; <a name="citation106c"></a><a href="#footnote106c"
class="citation">[106c]</a> all things, all, to them seemed
superfluity, for Poverty was their sentinel.&nbsp; They had no
neighbour by them, but ever against their narrow cabin gently
floated up the sea.</p>
<p>The chariot of the moon had not yet reached the mid-point of
her course, but their familiar toil awakened the fishermen; from
their eyelids they cast out slumber, and roused their souls with
speech. <a name="citation106d"></a><a href="#footnote106d"
class="citation">[106d]</a></p>
<p><i>Asphalion</i>.&nbsp; They lie all, my friend, who say that
the nights wane short in summer, when Zeus brings the long
days.&nbsp; Already have I seen ten thousand dreams, and the dawn
is not yet.&nbsp; Am I wrong, what ails them, the nights are
surely long?</p>
<p><i>The Friend</i>.&nbsp; Asphalion, thou blamest the beautiful
summer!&nbsp; It is not that the season hath wilfully passed his
natural course, but care, breaking thy sleep, makes night seem
long to thee.</p>
<p><i>Asphalion</i>.&nbsp; Didst ever learn to interpret dreams?
for good dreams have I beheld.&nbsp; I <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>would not
have thee to go without thy share in my vision; even as we go
shares in the fish we catch, so share all my dreams!&nbsp; Sure,
thou art not to be surpassed in wisdom; and he is the best
interpreter of dreams that hath wisdom for his teacher.&nbsp;
Moreover, we have time to idle in, for what could a man find to
do, lying on a leafy bed beside the wave and slumbering
not?&nbsp; Nay, the ass is among the thorns, the lantern in the
town hall, for, they say, it is always sleepless. <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a></p>
<p><i>The Friend</i>.&nbsp; Tell me, then, the vision of the
night; nay, tell all to thy friend.</p>
<p><i>Asphalion</i>.&nbsp; As I was sleeping late, amid the
labours of the salt sea (and truly not too full-fed, for we
supped early if thou dost remember, and did not overtax our
bellies), I saw myself busy on a rock, and there I sat and
watched the fishes, and kept spinning the bait with the
rods.&nbsp; And one of the fish nibbled, a fat one, for in sleep
dogs dream of bread, and of fish dream I.&nbsp; Well, he was
tightly hooked, and the blood was running, and the rod I grasped
was bent with his struggle.&nbsp; So with both hands I strained,
and had a sore tussle for the monster.&nbsp; How was I ever to
land so big a <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>fish with hooks all too slim?&nbsp; Then just to remind
him he was hooked, I gently pricked him, <a
name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> pricked, and slackened, and, as he
did not run, I took in line.&nbsp; My toil was ended with the
sight of my prize; I drew up a golden fish, lo you, a fish all
plated thick with gold!&nbsp; Then fear took hold of me, lest he
might be some fish beloved of Posidon, or perchance some jewel of
the sea-grey Amphitrite.&nbsp; Gently I unhooked him, lest ever
the hooks should retain some of the gold of his mouth.&nbsp; Then
I dragged him on shore with the ropes, <a
name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a> and swore that never again would I
set foot on sea, but abide on land, and lord it over the
gold.</p>
<p>This was even what wakened me, but, for <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the rest,
set thy mind to it, my friend, for I am in dismay about the oath
I swore.</p>
<p><i>The Friend</i>.&nbsp; Nay, never fear, thou art no more
sworn than thou hast found the golden fish of thy vision; dreams
are but lies.&nbsp; But if thou wilt search these waters, wide
awake, and not asleep, there is some hope in thy slumbers; seek
the fish of flesh, lest thou die of famine with all thy dreams of
gold!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hymn the children twain of Leda,
and of aegis-bearing Zeus,&mdash;Castor, and Pollux, the boxer
dread, when he hath harnessed his knuckles in thongs of
ox-hide.&nbsp; Twice hymn we, and thrice the stalwart sons of the
daughter of Thestias, the two brethren of Lacedaemon.&nbsp;
Succourers are they of men in the very thick of peril, and of
horses maddened in the bloody press of battle, and of ships that,
defying the stars that set and rise in heaven, have encountered
the perilous breath of storms.&nbsp; The winds raise huge billows
about their stern, yea, or from the prow, or even as each wind
wills, and cast them into the hold of the ship, and shatter both
bulwarks, while with the sail hangs all the gear confused and
broken, and the storm-rain falls from heaven as night creeps on,
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>and the
wide sea rings, being lashed by the gusts, and by showers of iron
hail.</p>
<p>Yet even so do ye draw forth the ships from the abyss, with
their sailors that looked immediately to die; and instantly the
winds are still, and there is an oily calm along the sea, and the
clouds flee apart, this way and that, also the <i>Bears</i>
appear, and in the midst, dimly seen, the <i>Asses&rsquo;
manger</i>, declaring that all is smooth for sailing.</p>
<p>O ye twain that aid all mortals, O beloved pair, ye knights,
ye harpers, ye wrestlers, ye minstrels, of Castor, or of
Polydeuces first shall I begin to sing?&nbsp; Of both of you will
I make my hymn, but first will I sing of Polydeuces.</p>
<p>Even already had Argo fled forth from the Clashing Rocks, and
the dread jaws of snowy Pontus, and was come to the land of the
Bebryces, with her crew, dear children of the gods.&nbsp; There
all the heroes disembarked, down one ladder, from both sides of
the ship of Iason.&nbsp; When they had landed on the deep
seashore and a sea-bank sheltered from the wind, they strewed
their beds, and their hands were busy with firewood. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a></p>
<p>Then Castor of the swift steeds, and swart Polydeuces, these
twain went wandering alone, apart from their fellows, and
marvelling at all the various wildwood on the mountain.&nbsp;
Beneath a smooth cliff they found an ever-flowing spring filled
with the purest water, and the <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>pebbles below shone like crystal or
silver from the deep.&nbsp; Tall fir trees grew thereby, and
white poplars, and planes, and cypresses with their lofty tufts
of leaves, and there bloomed all fragrant flowers that fill the
meadows when early summer is waning&mdash;dear work-steads of the
hairy bees.&nbsp; But there a monstrous man was sitting in the
sun, terrible of aspect; the bruisers&rsquo; hard fists had
crushed his ears, and his mighty breast and his broad back were
domed with iron flesh, like some huge statue of hammered
iron.&nbsp; The muscles on his brawny arms, close by the
shoulder, stood out like rounded rocks, that the winter torrent
has rolled, and worn smooth, in the great swirling stream, but
about his back and neck was draped a lion&rsquo;s skin, hung by
the claws.&nbsp; Him first accosted the champion, Polydeuces.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Good luck to thee, stranger,
whosoe&rsquo;er thou art!&nbsp; What men are they that possess
this land?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; What sort of luck, when I see men that I
never saw before?</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Fear not!&nbsp; Be sure that those
thou look&rsquo;st on are neither evil, nor the children of evil
men.</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; No fear have I, and it is not for thee to
teach me that lesson.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Art thou a savage, resenting all
address, or some vainglorious man?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; I am that thou see&rsquo;st, and on thy
land, at least, I trespass not.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Come, and with kindly gifts
return homeward again!</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Gift me no gifts, none such have I ready
for thee.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Nay, wilt thou not even grant us
leave to taste this spring?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; That shalt thou learn when thirst has
parched thy shrivelled lips.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; Will silver buy the boon, or with
what price, prithee, may we gain thy leave?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Put up thy hands and stand in single
combat, man to man.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; A boxing-match, or is kicking fair,
when we meet eye to eye?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Do thy best with thy fists and spare not
thy skill!</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; And who is the man on whom I am to
lay my hands and gloves?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Thou see&rsquo;st him close enough, the
boxer will not prove a maiden!</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; And is the prize ready, for which we
two must fight?</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Thy man shall I be called (shouldst thou
win), or thou mine, if I be victor.</p>
<p><i>Polydeuces</i>.&nbsp; On such terms fight the red-crested
birds of the game.</p>
<p><i>Amycus</i>.&nbsp; Well, be we like birds or lions, we shall
fight for no other stake.</p>
<p>So Amycus spoke, and seized and blew his hollow shell, and
speedily the long-haired Bebryces gathered beneath the shadowy
planes, <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>at the blowing of the shell.&nbsp; And in likewise did
Castor, eminent in war, go forth and summon all the heroes from
the Magnesian ship.&nbsp; And the champions, when they had
strengthened their fists with the stout ox-skin gloves, and bound
long leathern thongs about their arms, stepped into the ring,
breathing slaughter against each other.&nbsp; Then had they much
ado, in that assault,&mdash;which should have the sun&rsquo;s
light at his back.&nbsp; But by thy skill, Polydeuces, thou didst
outwit the giant, and the sun&rsquo;s rays fell full on the face
of Amycus.&nbsp; Then came he eagerly on in great wrath and heat,
making play with his fists, but the son of Tyndarus smote him on
the chin as he charged, maddening him even more, and the giant
confused the fighting, laying on with all his weight, and going
in with his head down.&nbsp; The Bebryces cheered their man, and
on the other side the heroes still encouraged stout Polydeuces,
for they feared lest the giant&rsquo;s weight, a match for
Tityus, might crush their champion in the narrow lists.&nbsp; But
the son of Zeus stood to him, shifting his ground again and
again, and kept smiting him, right and left, and somewhat checked
the rush of the son of Posidon, for all his monstrous
strength.&nbsp; Then he stood reeling like a drunken man under
the blows, and spat out the red blood, while all the heroes
together raised a cheer, as they marked the woful bruises about
his mouth and jaws, and how, as his face swelled up, his eyes
were half closed.&nbsp; Next, the prince teased him, feinting on
every side <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>but seeing now that the giant was all abroad, he
planted his fist just above the middle of the nose, beneath the
eyebrows, and skinned all the brow to the bone.&nbsp; Thus
smitten, Amycus lay stretched on his back, among the flowers and
grasses.&nbsp; There was fierce fighting when he arose again, and
they bruised each other well, laying on with the hard weighted
gloves; but the champion of the Bebryces was always playing on
the chest, and outside the neck, while unconquered Polydeuces
kept smashing his foeman&rsquo;s face with ugly blows.&nbsp; The
giant&rsquo;s flesh was melting away in his sweat, till from a
huge mass he soon became small enough, but the limbs of the other
waxed always stronger, and his colour better, as he warmed to his
work.</p>
<p>How then, at last, did the son of Zeus lay low the glutton?
say goddess, for thou knowest, but I, who am but the interpreter
of others, will speak all that thou wilt, and in such wise as
pleases thee.</p>
<p>Now behold the giant was keen to do some great feat, so with
his left hand he grasped the left of Polydeuces, stooping
slantwise from his onset, while with his other hand he made his
effort, and drove a huge fist up from his right haunch.&nbsp; Had
his blow come home, he would have harmed the King of Amyclae, but
he slipped his head out of the way, and then with his strong hand
struck Amycus on the left temple, putting his shoulder into the
blow.&nbsp; Quick gushed the black blood from the gaping <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>temple,
while Polydeuces smote the giant&rsquo;s mouth with his left, and
the close-set teeth rattled.&nbsp; And still he punished his face
with quick-repeated blows, till the cheeks were fairly
pounded.&nbsp; Then Amycus lay stretched all on the ground,
fainting, and held out both his hands, to show that he declined
the fight, for he was near to death.</p>
<p>There then, despite thy victory, didst thou work him no
insensate wrong, O boxer Polydeuces, but to thee he swore a
mighty oath, calling his sire Posidon from the deep, that
assuredly never again would he be violent to strangers.</p>
<p>Thee have I hymned, my prince; but thee now, Castor, will I
sing, O son of Tyndarus, O lord of the swift steeds, O wielder of
the spear, thou that wearest the corselet of bronze.</p>
<p>Now these twain, the sons of Zeus, had seized and were bearing
away the two daughters of Lycippus, and eagerly in sooth these
two other brethren were pursuing them, the sons of Aphareus, even
they that should soon have been the bridegrooms,&mdash;Lynceus
and mighty Idas.&nbsp; But when they were come to the tomb of the
dead Aphareus, then forth from their chariots they all sprang
together, and set upon each other, under the weight of their
spears and hollow shields.&nbsp; But Lynceus again spake, and
shouted loud from under his vizor:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sirs, wherefore desire ye battle, and how <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>are ye thus
violent to win the brides of others with naked swords in your
hands.&nbsp; To us, behold, did Leucippus betroth these his
daughters long before; to us this bridal is by oath
confirmed.&nbsp; And ye did not well, in that to win the wives of
others ye perverted him with gifts of oxen, and mules, and other
wealth, and so won wedlock by bribes.&nbsp; Lo many a time, in
face of both of you, I have spoken thus, I that am not a man of
many words, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Not thus, dear friends, does it
become heroes to woo their wives, wives that already have
bridegrooms betrothed.&nbsp; Lo Sparta is wide, and wide is Elis,
a land of chariots and horses, and Arcadia rich in sheep, and
there are the citadels of the Achaeans, and Messenia, and Argos,
and all the sea-coast of Sisyphus.&nbsp; There be maidens by
their parents nurtured, maidens countless, that lack not aught in
wisdom or in comeliness.&nbsp; Of these ye may easily win such as
ye will, for many are willing to be the fathers-in-law of noble
youths, and ye are the very choice of heroes all, as your fathers
were, and all your father&rsquo;s kin, and all your blood from of
old.&nbsp; But, friends, let this our bridal find its due
conclusion, and for you let all of us seek out another
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many such words I would speak, but the wind&rsquo;s
breath bare them away to the wet wave of the sea, and no favour
followed with my words.&nbsp; For ye twain are hard and
ruthless,&mdash;nay, but even now do ye listen, for ye are our
cousins, and kin by the father&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; But if <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>your heart
yet lusts for war, and with blood we must break up the kindred
strife, and end the feud, <a name="citation118"></a><a
href="#footnote118" class="citation">[118]</a> then Idas and his
cousin, mighty Polydeuces, shall hold their hands and abstain
from battle, but let us twain, Castor and I, the younger born,
try the ordeal of war!&nbsp; Let us not leave the heaviest of
grief to our fathers!&nbsp; Enough is one slain man from a house,
but the others will make festival for all their friends, and will
be bridegrooms, not slain men, and will wed these maidens.&nbsp;
Lo, it is fitting with light loss to end a great
dispute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he spake, and these words the gods were not to make
vain.&nbsp; For the elder pair laid down their harness from their
shoulders on the ground, but Lynceus stepped into the midst,
swaying his mighty spear beneath the outer rim of his shield, and
even so did Castor sway his spear-points, and the plumes were
nodding above the crests of each.&nbsp; With the sharp spears
long they laboured and tilted at each other, if perchance they
might anywhere spy a part of the flesh unarmed.&nbsp; But ere
either was wounded the spear-points were broken, fast stuck in
the linden shields.&nbsp; Then both drew their swords from the
sheaths, and again devised each the other&rsquo;s slaying, and
there was no truce in the fight.&nbsp; Many a time did Castor
smite on broad shield and horse-hair crest, and many a time the
keen-sighted Lynceus smote upon his shield, and his blade just
shore the <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>scarlet plume.&nbsp; Then, as he aimed the sharp sword
at the left knee, Castor drew back with his left foot, and hacked
the fingers off the hand of Lynceus.&nbsp; Then he being smitten
cast away his sword, and turned swiftly to flee to the tomb of
his father, where mighty Idas lay, and watched this strife of
kinsmen.&nbsp; But the son of Tyndarus sped after him, and drove
the broad sword through bowels and navel, and instantly the
bronze cleft all in twain, and Lynceus bowed, and on his face he
lay fallen on the ground, and forthwith heavy sleep rushed down
upon his eyelids.</p>
<p>Nay, nor that other of her children did Laocoosa see, by the
hearth of his fathers, after he had fulfilled a happy
marriage.&nbsp; For lo, Messenian Idas did swiftly break away the
standing stone from the tomb of his father Aphareus, and now he
would have smitten the slayer of his brother, but Zeus defended
him and drave the polished stone from the hands of Idas, and
utterly consumed him with a flaming thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Thus it is no light labour to war with the sons of Tyndarus,
for a mighty pair are they, and mighty is he that begat them.</p>
<p>Farewell, ye children of Leda, and all goodly renown send ye
ever to our singing.&nbsp; Dear are all minstrels to the sons of
Tyndarus, and to Helen, and to the other heroes that sacked Troy
in aid of Menelaus.</p>
<p>For you, O princes, the bard of Chios wrought renown, when he
sang the city of <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>Priam, and the ships of the Achaeans, and the Ilian
war, and Achilles, a tower of battle.&nbsp; And to you, in my

The beloved hated the lover, and had for him no gentleness at
all, and knew not Love, how mighty a God is he, and what a bow
his hands do wield, and what bitter arrows he dealeth at the
young.&nbsp; Yea, in all things ever, in speech and in all
approaches, was the beloved unyielding.&nbsp; Never was there any
assuagement of Love&rsquo;s fires, never was there a smile of the
lips, nor a bright glance of the eyes, never a blushing cheek,
nor a word, nor a kiss that lightens the burden of desire.&nbsp;
Nay, as a beast of the wild wood hath the hunters in watchful
dread, even so did the beloved in all things regard the man, with
angered lips, and eyes that had the dreadful glance of fate, and
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>the
whole face was answerable to this wrath, the colour fled from it,
sicklied o&rsquo;er with wrathful pride.&nbsp; Yet even thus was
the loved one beautiful, and the lover was the more moved by this
haughtiness.&nbsp; At length he could no more endure so fierce a
flame of the Cytherean, but drew near and wept by the hateful
dwelling, and kissed the lintel of the door, and thus he lifted
up his voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;O cruel child, and hateful, thou nursling of some
fierce lioness, O child all of stone unworthy of love; I have
come with these my latest gifts to thee, even this halter of
mine; for, child, I would no longer anger thee and work thee
pain.&nbsp; Nay, I am going where thou hast condemned me to fare,
where, as men say, is the path, and there the common remedy of
lovers, the River of Forgetfulness.&nbsp; Nay, but were I to take
and drain with my lips all the waters thereof, not even so shall
I quench my yearning desire.&nbsp; And now I bid my farewell to
these gates of thine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behold I know the thing that is to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, the rose is beautiful, and Time he withers it; and
fair is the violet in spring, and swiftly it waxes old; white is
the lily, it fadeth when it falleth; and snow is white, and
melteth after it hath been frozen.&nbsp; And the beauty of youth
is fair, but lives only for a little season.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That time will come when thou too shalt love, when thy
heart shall burn, and thou shalt weep salt tears.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&lsquo;But, child, do me even this last favour; when
thou comest forth, and see&rsquo;st me hanging in thy
gateway,&mdash;pass me not careless by, thy hapless lover, but
stand, and weep a little while; and when thou hast made this
libation of thy tears, then loose me from the rope, and cast over
me some garment from thine own limbs, and so cover me from sight;
but first kiss me for that latest time of all, and grant the dead
this grace of thy lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fear me not, I cannot live again, no, not though thou
shouldst be reconciled to me, and kiss me.&nbsp; A tomb for me do
thou hollow, to be the hiding-place of my love, and if thou
departest, cry thrice above me,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><i>O friend</i>,
<i>thou liest low</i>!</p>
<p>And if thou wilt, add this also,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><i>Alas</i>, <i>my
true friend is dead</i>!</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this legend do thou write, that I will scratch on
thy walls,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>This man Love slew</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Wayfarer</i>, <i>pass not heedless by</i>,<br />
<i>But stand</i>, <i>and say</i>, &ldquo;<i>he had a cruel
darling</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he seized a stone, and laid it against the wall, as
high as the middle of the doorposts, a dreadful stone, and from
the lintel he fastened the slender halter, and cast the noose
about his neck, and kicked away the support from under his foot,
and there was he hanged dead.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>But
the beloved opened the door, and saw the dead man hanging there
in the court, unmoved of heart, and tearless for the strange,
woful death; but on the dead man were all the garments of youth
defiled.&nbsp; Then forth went the beloved to the contests of the
wrestlers, and there was heart-set on the delightful
bathing-places, and even thereby encountered the very God
dishonoured, for Love stood on a pedestal of stone above the
waters. <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a>&nbsp; And lo, the statue leaped, and
slew that cruel one, and the water was red with blood, but the
voice of the slain kept floating to the brim.</p>
<p><i>Rejoice</i>, <i>ye lovers</i>, <i>for he that hated is
slain</i>.&nbsp; <i>Love</i>, <i>all ye beloved</i>, <i>for the
God knoweth how to deal righteous judgment</i>.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE INFANT HERACLES</span></h3>
<p><i>This poem describes the earliest feat of Heracles</i>,
<i>the slaying of the snakes sent against him by Hera</i>, <i>and
gives an account of the hero&rsquo;s training</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
vivacity and tenderness of the pictures of domestic life</i>,
<i>and the minute knowledge of expiatory ceremonies seem to stamp
this idyl as the work of Theocritus</i>.&nbsp; <i>As the
following poem also deals with an adventure of Heracles</i>,
<i>it seems not impossible that Theocritus wrote</i>, <i>or
contemplated writing</i>, <i>a Heraclean epic</i>, <i>in a series
of idyls</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Heracles was but ten months
old, the lady of Midea, even Alcmena, took him, on a time, and
Iphicles his brother, younger by one night, and gave them both
their bath, and their fill of milk, then laid them down in the
buckler of bronze, that goodly piece whereof Amphitryon had
strippen the fallen Pterelaus.&nbsp; And then the lady stroked
her children&rsquo;s heads, and spoke, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sleep, my little ones, a light delicious sleep; sleep,
soul of mine, two brothers, babes unharmed; blessed be your
sleep, and blessed may ye come to the dawn.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>So
speaking she rocked the huge shield, and in a moment sleep laid
hold on them.</p>
<p>But when the <i>Bear</i> at midnight wheels westward over
against <i>Orion</i> that shows his mighty shoulder, even then
did crafty Hera send forth two monstrous things, two snakes
bristling up their coils of azure; against the broad threshold,
where are the hollow pillars of the house-door she urged them;
with intent that they should devour the young child
Heracles.&nbsp; Then these twain crawled forth, writhing their
ravenous bellies along the ground, and still from their eyes a
baleful fire was shining as they came, and they spat out their
deadly venom.&nbsp; But when with their flickering tongues they
were drawing near the children, then Alcmena&rsquo;s dear babes
wakened, by the will of Zeus that knows all things, and there was
a bright light in the chamber.&nbsp; Then truly one child, even
Iphicles, screamed out straightway, when he beheld the hideous
monsters above the hollow shield, and saw their pitiless fangs,
and he kicked off the woollen coverlet with his feet, in his
eagerness to flee.&nbsp; But Heracles set his force against them,
and grasped them with his hands, binding them both in a grievous
bond, having got them by the throat, wherein lies the evil venom
of baleful snakes, the venom detested even by the gods.&nbsp;
Then the serpents, in their turn, wound with their coils about
the young child, the child unweaned, that wept never in his
nursling days; but again they relaxed their spines in stress, of
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>pain,
and strove to find some issue from the grasp of iron.</p>
<p>Now Alcmena heard the cry, and wakened first,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arise, Amphitryon, for numbing fear lays hold of me:
arise, nor stay to put shoon beneath thy feet!&nbsp; Hearest thou
not how loud the younger child is wailing?&nbsp; Mark&rsquo;st
thou not that though it is the depth of the night, the walls are
all plain to see as in the clear dawn? <a
name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a>&nbsp; There is some strange thing I
trow within the house, there is, my dearest lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus she spake, and at his wife&rsquo;s bidding he stepped
down out of his bed, and made for his richly dight sword that he
kept always hanging on its pin above his bed of cedar.&nbsp;
Verily he was reaching out for his new-woven belt, lifting with
the other hand the mighty sheath, a work of lotus wood, when lo,
the wide chamber was filled again with night.&nbsp; Then he cried
aloud on his thralls, who were drawing the deep breath of
sleep,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lights!&nbsp; Bring lights as quick as may be from the
hearth, my thralls, and thrust back the strong bolts of the
doors.&nbsp; Arise, ye serving-men, stout of heart, &rsquo;tis
the master calls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then quick the serving-men came speeding with torches burning,
and the house waxed full <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>as each man hasted along.&nbsp; Then
truly when they saw the young child Heracles clutching the snakes
twain in his tender grasp, they all cried out and smote their
hands together.&nbsp; But he kept showing the creeping things to
his father, Amphitryon, and leaped on high in his childish glee,
and laughing, at his father&rsquo;s feet he laid them down, the
dread monsters fallen on the sleep of death.&nbsp; Then Alcmena
in her own bosom took and laid Iphicles, dry-eyed and wan with
fear; <a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a> but Amphitryon, placing the other
child beneath a lamb&rsquo;s-wool coverlet, betook himself again
to his bed, and gat him to his rest.</p>
<p>The cocks were now but singing their third welcome to the
earliest dawn, when Alcmena called forth Tiresias, the seer that
cannot lie, and told him of the new portent, and bade him declare
what things should come to pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, and even if the gods devise some mischief, conceal
it not from me in ruth and pity; and how that mortals may not
escape the doom that Fate speeds from her spindle, O soothsayer
Euerides, I am teaching thee, that thyself knowest it right
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus spake the Queen, and thus he answered her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be of good cheer, daughter of Perseus, woman that hast
borne the noblest of children [and lay up in thy heart the better
of the things that are to be].&nbsp; For by the sweet light that
long hath left mine eyes, I swear that <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>many
Achaean women, as they card the soft wool about their knees,
shall sing at eventide, of Alcmena&rsquo;s name, and thou shalt
be honourable among the women of Argos.&nbsp; Such a man, even
this thy son, shall mount to the starry firmament, the hero broad
of breast, the master of all wild beasts, and of all
mankind.&nbsp; Twelve labours is he fated to accomplish, and
thereafter to dwell in the house of Zeus, but all his mortal part
a Trachinian pyre shall possess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the son of the Immortals, by virtue of his bride,
shall he be called, even of them that urged forth these snakes
from their dens to destroy the child.&nbsp; Verily that day shall
come when the ravening wolf, beholding the fawn in his lair, will
not seek to work him harm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But lady, see that thou hast fire at hand, beneath the
embers, and let make ready dry fuel of gorse, or thorn, or
bramble, or pear boughs dried with the wind&rsquo;s buffeting,
and on the wild fire burn these serpents twain, at midnight, even
at the hour when they would have slain thy child.&nbsp; But at
dawn let one of thy maidens gather the dust of the fire, and bear
and cast it all, every grain, over the river from the brow of the
broken cliff, <a name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a> beyond the march of your land, and
return again without looking <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>behind.&nbsp; Then cleanse your
house with the fire of unmixed sulphur first, and then, as is
ordained, with a filleted bough sprinkle holy water over all,
mingled with salt. <a name="citation130"></a><a
href="#footnote130" class="citation">[130]</a>&nbsp; And to Zeus
supreme, moreover, do ye sacrifice a young boar, that ye may ever
have the mastery over all your enemies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and thrust back his ivory chair, and departed,
even Tiresias, despite the weight of all his many years.</p>
<p>But Heracles was reared under his mother&rsquo;s care, like
some young sapling in a garden close, being called the son of
Amphitryon of Argos.&nbsp; And the lad was taught his letters by
the ancient Linus, Apollo&rsquo;s son, a tutor ever
watchful.&nbsp; And to draw the bow, and send the arrow to the
mark did Eurytus teach him, Eurytus rich in wide ancestral
lands.&nbsp; And Eumolpus, son of Philammon, made the lad a
minstrel, and formed his hands to the boxwood lyre.&nbsp; And all
the tricks wherewith the nimble Argive cross-buttockers give each
other the fall, and all the wiles of boxers skilled with the
gloves, and all the art that the rough and tumble fighters have
sought out to aid their science, all these did Heracles learn
from Harpalacus of Phanes, the son of Hermes.&nbsp; Him no man
that beheld, even from afar, would have confidently met as a
wrestler in the lists, so grim a brow overhung his dreadful
face.&nbsp; And to drive forth his horses &rsquo;neath the
chariot, and safely to guide them <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>round the goals, with the naves of
the wheels unharmed, Amphitryon taught his son in his
loving-kindness, Amphitryon himself, for many a prize had he
borne away from the fleet races in Argos, pasture-land of steeds,
and unbroken were the chariots that he mounted, till time
loosened their leathern thongs.</p>
<p>But to charge with spear in rest, against a foe, guarding,
meanwhile, his back with the shield, to bide the biting swords,
to order a company, and to measure, in his onslaught, the ambush
of foemen, and to give horsemen the word of command, he was
taught by knightly Castor.&nbsp; An outlaw came Castor out of
Argos, when Tydeus was holding all the land and all the wide
vineyards, having received Argos, a land of steeds, from the hand
of Adrastus.&nbsp; No peer in war among the demigods had Castor,
till age wore down his youth.</p>
<p>Thus did his dear mother let train Heracles, and the
child&rsquo;s bed was made hard by his father&rsquo;s; a
lion&rsquo;s skin was the coverlet he loved; his dinner was roast
meat, and a great Dorian loaf in a basket, a meal to satisfy a
delving hind.&nbsp; At the close of day he would take a meagre
supper that needed no fire to the cooking, and his plain kirtle
fell no lower than the middle of his shin.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">HERACLES THE LION-SLAYER</span></h3>
<p><i>This is another idyl of the epic sort</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
poet&rsquo;s interest in the details of the rural life</i>,
<i>and in the description of the herds of King Augeas</i>,
<i>seem to mark it as the work of Theocritus</i>.&nbsp; <i>It
has</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>been attributed by learned conjecture
to various writers of an older age</i>.&nbsp; <i>The idyl</i>,
<i>or fragment</i>, <i>is incomplete</i>.&nbsp; <i>Heracles
visits the herds of Augeas</i> (<i>to clean their stalls was one
of his labours</i>), <i>and</i>, <i>after an encounter with a
bull</i>, <i>describes to the king&rsquo;s son his battle with
the lion of Nemea</i>.</p>
<p>. . . Him answered the old man, a husbandman that had the care
of the tillage, ceasing a moment from the work that lay betwixt
his hands&mdash;&lsquo;Right readily will I tell thee, stranger,
concerning the things whereof thou inquirest, for I revere the
awful wrath of Hermes of the roadside.&nbsp; Yea he, they say, is
of all the heavenly Gods the most in anger, if any deny the
wayfarer that asks eagerly for the way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fleecy flocks of the king Augeas feed not all on
one pasture, nor in one place, but some there be that graze by
the river-banks <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>round Elisus, and some by the sacred stream of divine
Alpheius, and some by Buprasium rich in clusters of the vine, and
some even in this place.&nbsp; And behold, the pens for each herd
after its kind are builded apart.&nbsp; Nay, but for all the
herds of Augeas, overflowing as they be, these pasture lands are
ever fresh and flowering, around the great marsh of Peneus, for
with herbage honey-sweet the dewy water-meadows are ever
blossoming abundantly, and this fodder it is that feeds the
strength of horned kine.&nbsp; And this their steading, on thy
right hand stands all plain to view, beyond the running river,
there, where the plane-trees grow luxuriant, and the green wild
olive, a sacred grove, O stranger, of Apollo of the pastures, a
God most gracious unto prayer.&nbsp; Next thereto are builded
long rows of huts for the country folk, even for us that do
zealously guard the great and marvellous wealth of the king;
casting in season the seed in fallow lands, thrice, ay, and four
times broken by the plough.&nbsp; As for the marches, truly, the
ditchers know them, men of many toils, who throng to the
wine-press at the coming of high summer tide.&nbsp; For, behold,
all this plain is held by gracious Augeas, and the wheat-bearing
plough-land, and the orchards with their trees, as far as the
upland farm of the ridge, whence the fountains spring; over all
which lands we go labouring, the whole day long, as is the wont
of thralls that live their lives among the fields.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, prithee, tell thou me, in thy turn (and <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>for thine
own gain it will be), whom comest thou hither to seek; in quest,
perchance, of Augeas, or one of his servants?&nbsp; Of all these
things, behold, I have knowledge, and could tell thee plainly,
for methinks that thou, for thy part, comest of no churlish
stock, nay, nor hath thy shape aught of the churl, so excellent
in might shows thy form.&nbsp; Lo, now, even such are the
children of the immortal Gods among mortal men.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
the mighty son of Zeus answered him, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, old man, I fain would see Augeas, prince of the
Epeans, for truly &rsquo;twas need of him that brought me
hither.&nbsp; If he abides at the town with his citizens, caring
for his people, and settling the pleas, do thou, old man, bid one
of the servants to guide me on the way, a head-man of the more
honourable sort in these fields, to whom I may both tell my
desire, and learn in turn what I would, for God has made all men
dependent, each on each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the old man, the worthy husbandman, answered him
again&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the guidance of some one of the immortals hast thou
come hither, stranger, for verily all that thou requirest hath
quickly been fulfilled.&nbsp; For hither hath come Augeas, the
dear son of Helios, with his own son, the strong and princely
Phyleus.&nbsp; But yesterday he came hither from the city, to be
overseeing after many days his substance, that he hath uncounted
in the fields.&nbsp; Thus do even kings in their inmost hearts
believe that the eye of the <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>master makes the house more
prosperous.&nbsp; Nay come, let us hasten to him, and I will lead
thee to our dwelling, where methinks we shall find the
king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he spake, and began to lead the way, but in his mind, as he
marked the lion&rsquo;s hide, and the club that filled the
stranger&rsquo;s fist, the old man was deeply pondering as to
whence he came, and ever he was eager to inquire of him.&nbsp;
But back again he kept catching the word as it rose to his lips,
in fear lest he should speak somewhat out of season (his
companion being in haste) for hard it is to know another&rsquo;s
mood.</p>
<p>Now as they began to draw nigh, the dogs from afar were
instantly aware of them, both by the scent, and by the sound of
footsteps, and, yelling furiously, they charged from all sides
against Heracles, son of Amphitryon, while with faint yelping, on
the other side, they greeted the old man, and fawned around
him.&nbsp; But he just lifted stones from the ground, <a
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> and scared them away, and, raising his
voice, he right roughly chid them all, and made them cease from
their yelping, being glad in his heart withal for that they
guarded his dwelling, even when he was afar.&nbsp; Then thus he
spake&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lo, what a comrade for men have the Gods, the lords of
all, made in this creature, how mindful is he!&nbsp; If he had
but so much wit within him as to know against whom he should <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>rage, and
with whom he should forbear, no beast in the world could vie with
his deserts.&nbsp; But now he is something over-fierce and
blindly furious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he spake, and they hastened, and came even to that dwelling
whither they were faring.</p>
<p>Now Helios had turned his steeds to the west, bringing the
late day, and the fatted sheep came up from the pastures to the
pens and folds.&nbsp; Next thereafter the kine approaching, ten
thousand upon ten thousand, showed for multitude even like the
watery clouds that roll forward in heaven under the stress of the
South Wind, or the Thracian North (and countless are they, and
ceaseless in their airy passage, for the wind&rsquo;s might rolls
up the rear as numerous as the van, and hosts upon hosts again
are moving in infinite array), even so many did herds upon herds
of kine move ever forwards.&nbsp; And, lo, the whole plain was
filled, and all the ways, as the cattle fared onwards, and the
rich fields could not contain their lowing, and the stalls were
lightly filled with kine of trailing feet, and the sheep were
being penned in the folds.</p>
<p>There no man, for lack of labour, stood idle by the cattle,
though countless men were there, but one was fastening guards of
wood, with shapely thongs, about the feet of the kine, that he
might draw near and stand by, and milk them.&nbsp; And another
beneath their mothers kind was placing the calves right eager to
drink of the sweet milk.&nbsp; Yet another held a <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>milking
pail, while his fellow was fixing the rich cheese, and another
led in the bulls apart from the cows.&nbsp; Meanwhile Augeas was
going round all the stalls, and marking the care his herdsmen
bestowed upon all that was his.&nbsp; And the king&rsquo;s son,
and the mighty, deep-pondering Heracles, went along with the
king, as he passed through his great possessions.&nbsp; Then
though he bore a stout spirit in his heart, and a mind stablished
always imperturbable, yet the son of Amphitryon still marvelled
out of measure, as he beheld these countless troops of
cattle.&nbsp; Yea none would have deemed or believed that the
substance of one man could be so vast, nay, nor ten men&rsquo;s
wealth, were they the richest in sheep of all the kings in the
world.&nbsp; But Helios to his son gave this gift pre-eminent,
namely to abound in flocks far above all other men, and Helios
himself did ever and always give increase to the cattle, for upon
his herds came no disease, of them that always minish the
herdman&rsquo;s toil.&nbsp; But always more in number waxed the
horned kine, and goodlier, year by year, for verily they all
brought forth exceeding abundantly, and never cast their young,
and chiefly bare heifers.</p>
<p>With the kine went continually three hundred bulls,
white-shanked, and curved of horn,&mdash;and two hundred others,
red cattle,&mdash;and all these already were of an age to mate
with the kine.&nbsp; Other twelve bulls, again, besides these,
went together in a herd, being sacred to Helios.&nbsp; They were
white as swans, and shone among <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>all the herds of trailing
gait.&nbsp; And these disdaining the herds grazed still on the
rich herbage in the pastures, and they were exceeding high of
heart.&nbsp; And whensoever the swift wild beasts came down from
the rough oakwood to the plain, to seek the wilder cattle, afield
went these bulls first to the fight, at the smell of the savour
of the beasts, bellowing fearfully, and glancing slaughter from
their brows.</p>
<p>Among these bulls was one pre-eminent for strength and might,
and for reckless pride, even the mighty Phaethon, that all the
herdsmen still likened to a star, because he always shone so
bright when he went among the other cattle, and was right easy to
be discerned.&nbsp; Now when this bull beheld the dried skin of
the fierce-faced lion, he rushed against the keen-eyed Heracles
himself, to dash his head and stalwart front against the sides of
the hero.&nbsp; Even as he charged, the prince forthwith grasped
him with strong hand by the left horn, and bowed his neck down to
the ground, puissant as he was, and, with the weight of his
shoulder, crushed him backwards, while clear stood out the
strained muscle over the sinews on the hero&rsquo;s upper
arm.&nbsp; Then marvelled the king himself, and his son, the
warlike Phyleus, and the herdsmen that were set over the horned
kine,&mdash;when they beheld the exceeding strength of the son of
Amphitryon.</p>
<p>Now these twain, even Phyleus and mighty Heracles, left the
fat fields there, and were making for the city.&nbsp; But just
where they <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>entered on the highway, after quickly speeding over the
narrow path that stretched through the vineyard from the
farmhouses, a dim path through the green wood, thereby the dear
son of Augeas bespake the child of supreme Zeus, who was behind
him, slightly turning his head over his right shoulder,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stranger, long time ago I heard a tale, which, as of
late I guess, surely concerneth thee.&nbsp; For there came
hither, in his wayfaring out of Argos, a certain young Achaean,
from Helic&eacute;, by the seashore, who verily told a tale and
that among many Epeians here,&mdash;how, even in his presence, a
certain Argive slew a wild beast, a lion dread, a curse of evil
omen to the country folk.&nbsp; The monster had its hollow lair
by the grove of Nemean Zeus, but as for him that slew it, I know
not surely whether he was a man of sacred Argos, there, or a
dweller in Tiryns city, or in Mycenae, as he that told the tale
declared.&nbsp; By birth, howbeit, he said (if rightly, I recall
it) that the hero was descended from Perseus.&nbsp; Methinks that
none of the Aegialeis had the hardihood for this deed save
thyself; nay, the hide of the beast that covers thy sides doth
clearly proclaim the mighty deed of thy hands.&nbsp; But come
now, hero, tell thou me first, that truly I may know, whether my
foreboding be right or wrong,&mdash;if thou art that man of whom
the Achaean from Helic&eacute; spake in our hearing, and if I
read thee aright.&nbsp; Tell me how single-handed thou didst slay
this ruinous pest, and <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>how it came to the well-watered
ground of Nemea, for not in Apis couldst thou find,&mdash;not
though thou soughtest after it,&mdash;so great a monster.&nbsp;
For the country feeds no such large game, but bears, and boars,
and the pestilent race of wolves.&nbsp; Wherefore all were in
amaze that listened to the story, and there were some who said
that the traveller was lying, and pleasing them that stood by
with the words of an idle tongue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus Phyleus spake, and stepped out of the middle of the road,
that there might be space for both to walk abreast, and that so
he might hear the more easily the words of Heracles who now came
abreast with him, and spake thus,</p>
<p>&lsquo;O son of Augeas, concerning that whereof thou first
didst ask me, thyself most easily hast discerned it aright.&nbsp;
Nay then, about this monster I will tell thee all, even how all
was done,&mdash;since thou art eager to hear,&mdash;save, indeed,
as to whence he came, for, many as the Argives be, not one can
tell that clearly.&nbsp; Only we guess that some one of the
Immortals, in wrath for sacrifice unoffered, sent this bane
against the children of Phoroneus.&nbsp; For over all the men of
Pisa the lion swept, like a flood, and still ravaged insatiate,
and chiefly spoiled the Bembinaeans, that were his neighbours,
and endured things intolerable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now this labour did Eurystheus enjoin on me to fulfil
the first of all, and bade me slay the dreadful monster.&nbsp; So
I took my supple bow, and hollow quiver full of arrows, and set
<a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>forth;
and in my other hand I held my stout club, well balanced, and
wrought, with unstripped bark, from a shady wild olive-tree, that
I myself had found, under sacred Helicon, and dragged up the
whole tree, with the bushy roots.&nbsp; But when I came to the
place whereby the lion abode, even then I grasped my bow and
slipped the string up to the curved tip, and straightway laid
thereon the bitter arrow.&nbsp; Then I cast my eyes on every
side, spying for the baneful monster, if perchance I might see
him, or ever he saw me.&nbsp; It was now midday, and nowhere
might I discern the tracks of the monster, nor hear his
roaring.&nbsp; Nay, nor was there one man to be seen with the
cattle, and the tillage through all the furrowed lea, of whom I
might inquire, but wan fear still held them all within the
homesteads.&nbsp; Yet I stayed not in my going, as I quested
through the deep-wooded hill, till I beheld him, and instantly
essayed my prowess.&nbsp; Now early in the evening he was making
for his lair, full fed with blood and flesh, and all his
bristling mane was dashed with carnage, and his fierce face, and
his breast, and still with his tongue he kept licking his bearded
chin.&nbsp; Then instantly I hid me in the dark undergrowth, on
the wooded hill, awaiting his approach, and as he came nearer I
smote him on the left flank, but all in vain, for naught did the
sharp arrow pierce through his flesh, but leaped back, and fell
on the green grass.&nbsp; Then quickly he raised his tawny head
from the ground, in amaze, glancing all around with <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>his eyes,
and with jaws distent he showed his ravenous teeth.&nbsp; Then I
launched against him another shaft from the string, in wrath that
the former flew vainly from my hand, and I smote him right in the
middle of the breast, where the lung is seated, yet not even so
did the cruel arrow sink into his hide, but fell before his feet,
in vain, to no avail.&nbsp; Then for the third time was I making
ready to draw my bow again, in great shame and wrath, but the
furious beast glanced his eyes around, and spied me.&nbsp; With
his long tail he lashed his flanks, and straightway bethought him
of battle.&nbsp; His neck was clothed with wrath, and his tawny
hair bristled round his lowering brow, and his spine was curved
like a bow, his whole force being gathered up from under towards
his flanks and loins.&nbsp; And as when a wainwright, one skilled
in many an art, doth bend the saplings of seasoned fig-tree,
having first tempered them in the fire, to make tires for the
axles of his chariot, and even then the fig-tree wood is like to
leap from his hands in the bending, and springs far away at a
single bound, even so the dread lion leaped on me from afar,
huddled in a heap, and keen to glut him with my flesh.&nbsp; Then
with one hand I thrust in front of me my arrows, and the double
folded cloak from my shoulder, and with the other raised the
seasoned club above my head, and drove at his crest, and even on
the shaggy scalp of the insatiate beast brake my grievous cudgel
of wild olive-tree.&nbsp; Then or ever he <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>reached me,
he fell from his flight, on to the ground, and stood on trembling
feet, with wagging head, for darkness gathered about both his
eyes, his brain being shaken in his skull with the violence of
the blow.&nbsp; Then when I marked how he was distraught with the
grievous torment, or ever he could turn and gain breath again, I
fell on him, and seized him by the column of his stubborn
neck.&nbsp; To earth I cast my bow, and woven quiver, and
strangled him with all my force, gripping him with stubborn clasp
from the rear, lest he should rend my flesh with his claws, and I
sprang on him and kept firmly treading his hind feet into the
soil with my heels, while I used his sides to guard my thighs,
till I had strained his shoulders utterly, then lifted him up,
all breathless,&mdash;and Hell took his monstrous life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then at last I took thought how I should strip the
rough hide from the dead beast&rsquo;s limbs, a right hard
labour, for it might not be cut with steel, when I tried, nor
stone, nor with aught else. <a name="citation143"></a><a
href="#footnote143" class="citation">[143]</a>&nbsp; Thereon one
of the Immortals put into my mind the thought to cleave the
lion&rsquo;s hide with his own claws.&nbsp; With these I speedily
flayed it off, and cast it about my limbs, for my defence against
the brunt of wounding war.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friend, lo even thus befel the slaying of the Nemean
Lion, that aforetime had brought many a bane on flocks and
men.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>This idyl narrates the murder of Pentheus</i>, <i>who was
torn to pieces</i> (<i>after the Dionysiac Ritual</i>) <i>by his
mother</i>, <i>Agave</i>, <i>and other Theban women</i>, <i>for
having watched the celebration of the mysteries of
Dionysus</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is still dangerous for an Australian
native to approach the women of the tribe while they are
celebrating their savage rites</i>.&nbsp; <i>The conservatism of
Greek religion is well illustrated by Theocritus&rsquo;s apology
for the truly savage revenge commemorated in the old Theban
legend</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ino</span>, and Autonoe, and Agave of the
apple cheeks,&mdash;three bands of Maenads to the mountain-side
they led, these ladies three.&nbsp; They stripped the wild leaves
of a rugged oak, and fresh ivy, and asphodel of the upper earth,
and in an open meadow they built twelve altars; for Semele three,
and nine for Dionysus.&nbsp; The mystic cakes <a
name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a> from the mystic chest they had taken
in their hands, and in silence had laid them on the altars of
new-stripped boughs; so Dionysus ever taught the rite, and
herewith was he wont to be well pleased.</p>
<p>Now Pentheus from a lofty cliff was watching <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>all, deep
hidden in an ancient lentisk hush, a plant of that land.&nbsp;
Autonoe first beheld him, and shrieked a dreadful yell, and,
rushing suddenly, with her feet dashed all confused the mystic
things of Bacchus the wild.&nbsp; For these are things unbeholden
of men profane.&nbsp; Frenzied was she, and then forthwith the
others too were frenzied.&nbsp; Then Pentheus fled in fear, and
they pursued after him, with raiment kirtled through the belt
above the knee.</p>
<p>This much said Pentheus, &lsquo;Women, what would ye?&rsquo;
and thus answered Autonoe, &lsquo;That shalt thou straightway
know, ere thou hast heard it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother seized her child&rsquo;s head, and cried loud, as
is the cry of a lioness over her cubs, while Ino, for her part,
set her heel on the body, and brake asunder the broad shoulder,
shoulder-blade and all, and in the same strain wrought
Autonoe.&nbsp; The other women tore the remnants piecemeal, and
to Thebes they came, all bedabbled with blood, from the mountains
bearing not Pentheus but repentance. <a name="citation145"></a><a
href="#footnote145" class="citation">[145]</a></p>
<p>I care for none of these things, nay, nor let another take
thought to make himself the foe of Dionysus, not though one
should suffer yet greater torments than these,&mdash;being but a
child of nine years old or entering, perchance, on his tenth
year.&nbsp; For me, may I be pure and holy, and find favour in
the eyes of the pure!</p>
<p>From aegis-bearing Zeus hath this augury <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>all honour,
&lsquo;to the children of the godly the better fortune, but evil
befall the offspring of the ungodly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hail to Dionysus, whom Zeus supreme brought forth in
snowy Dracanus, when he had unburdened his mighty thigh, and hail
to beautiful Semele: and to her sisters,&mdash;Cadmeian ladies
honoured of all daughters of heroes,&mdash;who did this deed at
the behest of Dionysus, a deed not to be blamed; let no man blame
the actions of the gods.&rsquo;</p>

minds of men, and has wrought to tenderness my heart that was of
steel.&nbsp; Nay, by thy delicate mouth I approach and beseech
thee, remember that thou wert younger yesteryear, and that we wax

<i>For a Picture</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Thou</span> sleepest on the leaf-strewn
ground, O Daphnis, resting thy weary limbs, and the stakes of thy
nets are newly fastened on the hills.&nbsp; But Pan is on thy
track, and Priapus, with the golden ivy wreath twined round his
winsome head,&mdash;both are leaping at one bound into thy

off the heavy sleep that is falling upon thee.</p>
<h4>IV<br />
<i>Priapus</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> thou hast turned yonder lane,
goatherd, where the oak-trees are, thou wilt find an image of
fig-tree wood, newly carven; three-legged it is, the bark still
covers it, and it is earless withal, yet meet for the arts of
Cypris.&nbsp; A right holy precinct runs round it, and a
ceaseless stream that falleth from the rocks on every side is
green with laurels, and myrtles, and fragrant cypress.&nbsp; And
all around the place that child of the grape, the vine, doth
flourish with its tendrils, and the merles in <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>spring with
their sweet songs utter their wood-notes wild, and the brown
nightingales reply with their complaints, pouring from their
bills the honey-sweet song.&nbsp; There, prithee, sit down and
pray to gracious Priapus, that I may be delivered from my love of
Daphnis, and say that instantly thereon I will sacrifice a fair
kid.&nbsp; But if he refuse, ah then, should I win
Daphnis&rsquo;s love, I would fain sacrifice three
victims,&mdash;and offer a calf, a shaggy he-goat, and a lamb
that I keep in the stall, and oh that graciously the god may hear
my prayer.</p>

<i>The rural Concert</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Ah</span>, in the Muses&rsquo; name, wilt
thou play me some sweet air on the double flute, and I will take
up the harp, and touch a note, and the neatherd Daphnis will
charm us the while, breathing music into his wax-bound
pipe.&nbsp; And beside this rugged oak behind the cave will we
stand, and rob the goat-foot Pan of his repose.</p>
<h4>VI<br />
<i>The Dead are beyond hope</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Ah</span> hapless Thyrsis, where is thy

tears?&nbsp; She has passed away,&mdash;the kid, the youngling
beautiful,&mdash;she has <a name="page162"></a><span

<span class="GutSmall">THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS</span></h3>
<p><i>This poem was probably intended to be sung at one of the
spring celebrations of the festival of Adonis</i>, <i>like that
described by Theocritus in his fifteenth idyl</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Woe</span>, woe for Adonis, he hath
perished, the beauteous Adonis, dead is the beauteous Adonis, the
Loves join in the lament.&nbsp; No more in thy purple raiment,
Cypris, do thou sleep; arise, thou wretched one, sable-stoled,
and beat thy breasts, and say to all, &lsquo;He hath perished,
the lovely Adonis!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Adonis</i>, <i>the Loves join in the
lament</i>!</p>
<p>Low on the hills is lying the lovely Adonis, and his thigh
with the boar&rsquo;s tusk, his white thigh with the boar&rsquo;s
tusk is wounded, and sorrow on Cypris he brings, as softly he
breathes his life away.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>His
dark blood drips down his skin of snow, beneath his brows his
eyes wax heavy and dim, and the rose flees from his lip, and
thereon the very kiss is dying, the kiss that Cypris will never
forego.</p>
<p>To Cypris his kiss is dear, though he lives no longer, but
Adonis knew not that she kissed him as he died.</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Adonis</i>, <i>the Loves join in the
lament</i>!</p>
<p>A cruel, cruel wound on his thigh hath Adonis, but a deeper
wound in her heart doth Cytherea bear.&nbsp; About him his dear
hounds are loudly baying, and the nymphs of the wild wood wail
him; but Aphrodite with unbound locks through the glades goes
wandering,&mdash;wretched, with hair unbraided, with feet
unsandaled, and the thorns as she passes wound her and pluck the
blossom of her sacred blood.&nbsp; Shrill she wails as down the
long woodlands she is borne, lamenting her Assyrian lord, and
again calling him, and again.&nbsp; But round his navel the dark
blood leapt forth, with blood from his thighs his chest was
scarlet, and beneath Adonis&rsquo;s breast, the spaces that afore
were snow-white, were purple with blood.</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Cytherea</i>, <i>the Loves join in the
lament</i>!</p>
<p>She hath lost her lovely lord, with him she hath lost her
sacred beauty.&nbsp; Fair was the form of Cypris, while Adonis
was living, but <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>her beauty has died with Adonis!&nbsp; <i>Woe</i>,
<i>woe for Cypris</i>, the mountains all are saying, and the
oak-trees answer, <i>Woe for Adonis</i>.&nbsp; And the rivers
bewail the sorrows of Aphrodite, and the wells are weeping Adonis
on the mountains.&nbsp; The flowers flush red for anguish, and
Cytherea through all the mountain-knees, through every dell doth
shrill the piteous dirge.</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Cytherea</i>, <i>he hath perished</i>,
<i>the lovely Adonis</i>!</p>
<p>And Echo cried in answer, <i>He hath perished</i>, <i>the
lovely Adonis</i>.&nbsp; Nay, who but would have lamented the
grievous love of Cypris?&nbsp; When she saw, when she marked the
unstaunched wound of Adonis, when she saw the bright red blood
about his languid thigh, she cast her arms abroad and moaned,
&lsquo;Abide with me, Adonis, hapless Adonis abide, that this
last time of all I may possess thee, that I may cast myself about
thee, and lips with lips may mingle.&nbsp; Awake Adonis, for a
little while, and kiss me yet again, the latest kiss!&nbsp; Nay
kiss me but a moment, but the lifetime of a kiss, till from thine
inmost soul into my lips, into my heart, thy life-breath ebb, and
till I drain thy sweet love-philtre, and drink down all thy
love.&nbsp; This kiss will I treasure, even as thyself; Adonis,
since, ah ill-fated, thou art fleeing me, thou art fleeing far,
Adonis, and art faring to Acheron, to that hateful king and
cruel, while wretched I yet live, being a goddess, and may not
follow thee!&nbsp; Persephone, <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>take thou my lover, my lord, for thy
self art stronger than I, and all lovely things drift down to
thee.&nbsp; But I am all ill-fated, inconsolable is my anguish,
and I lament mine Adonis, dead to me, and I have no rest for
sorrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou diest, O thrice-desired, and my desire hath flown
away as a dream.&nbsp; Nay, widowed is Cytherea, and idle are the
Loves along the halls!&nbsp; With thee has the girdle of my
beauty perished.&nbsp; For why, ah overbold, didst thou follow
the chase, and being so fair, why wert thou thus overhardy to
fight with beasts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Cypris bewailed her, the Loves join in the lament:</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Cytherea</i>, <i>he hath perished the
lovely Adonis</i>!</p>
<p>A tear the Paphian sheds for each blood-drop of Adonis, and
tears and blood on the earth are turned to flowers.&nbsp; The
blood brings forth the rose, the tears, the wind-flower.</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Adonis</i>, <i>he hath perished</i>;
<i>the lovely Adonis</i>!</p>
<p>No more in the oak-woods, Cypris, lament thy lord.&nbsp; It is
no fair couch for Adonis, the lonely bed of leaves!&nbsp; Thine
own bed, Cytherea, let him now possess,&mdash;the dead
Adonis.&nbsp; Ah, even in death he is beautiful, beautiful in
death, as one that hath fallen on sleep.&nbsp; Now lay him down
to sleep in his own soft coverlets, wherein with thee through the
night he shared <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>the holy slumber in a couch all of gold, that yearns
for Adonis, though sad is he to look upon.&nbsp; Cast on him
garlands and blossoms: all things have perished in his death, yea
all the flowers are faded.&nbsp; Sprinkle him with ointments of
Syria, sprinkle him with unguents of myrrh.&nbsp; Nay, perish all
perfumes, for Adonis, who was thy perfume, hath perished.</p>
<p>He reclines, the delicate Adonis, in his raiment of purple,
and around him the Loves are weeping, and groaning aloud,
clipping their locks for Adonis.&nbsp; And one upon his shafts,
another on his bow is treading, and one hath loosed the sandal of
Adonis, and another hath broken his own feathered quiver, and one
in a golden vessel bears water, and another laves the wound, and
another from behind him with his wings is fanning Adonis.</p>
<p><i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Cytherea</i>, <i>the Loves join in the
lament</i>!</p>
<p>Every torch on the lintels of the door has Hymenaeus quenched,
and hath torn to shreds the bridal crown, and <i>Hymen</i> no
more, <i>Hymen</i> no more is the song, but a new song is sung of
wailing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Woe</i>, <i>woe for Adonis</i>,&rsquo; rather than
the nuptial song the Graces are shrilling, lamenting the son of
Cinyras, and one to the other declaring, <i>He hath perished</i>,
<i>the lovely Adonis</i>.</p>
<p>And <i>woe</i>, <i>woe for Adonis</i>, shrilly cry the Muses,
neglecting Paeon, and they lament <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Adonis aloud, and songs they chant
to him, but he does not heed them, not that he is loth to hear,
but that the Maiden of Hades doth not let him go.</p>
<p>Cease, Cytherea, from thy lamentations, to-day refrain from
thy dirges.&nbsp; Thou must again bewail him, again must weep for
him another year.</p>

<p><i>Myrson</i>.&nbsp; Wilt thou be pleased now, Lycidas, to

<p><i>Lycidas</i>.&nbsp; Yes, Myrson, and I too fain would pipe,
but what shall I sing?</p>
<p><i>Myrson</i>.&nbsp; A song of Scyra, Lycidas, is my
desire,&mdash;a sweet love-story,&mdash;the stolen kisses of the
son of Peleus, the stolen bed of love how he, that was a boy, did
on the weeds of women, and how he belied his form, and how among
the heedless daughters of Lycomedes, Deidamia cherished Achilles
in her bower. <a name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"

<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span><i>Lycidas</i>.&nbsp; The herdsman bore off Helen, upon
a time, and carried her to Ida, sore sorrow to &OElig;none.&nbsp;
And Lacedaemon waxed wroth, and gathered together all the Achaean
folk; there was never a Hellene, not one of the Mycenaeans, nor
any man of Elis, nor of the Laconians, that tarried in his house,
and shunned the cruel Ares.</p>
<p>But Achilles alone lay hid among the daughters of Lycomedes,
and was trained to work in wools, in place of arms, and in his
white hand held the bough of maidenhood, in semblance a
maiden.&nbsp; For he put on women&rsquo;s ways, like them, and a
bloom like theirs blushed on his cheek of snow, and he walked
with maiden gait, and covered his locks with the snood.&nbsp; But
the heart of a man had he, and the love of a man.&nbsp; From dawn
to dark he would sit by Deidamia, and anon would kiss her hand,
and oft would lift the beautiful warp of her loom and praise the
sweet threads, having no such joy in any other girl of her
company.&nbsp; Yea, all things he essayed, and all for one end,
that they twain might share an undivided sleep.</p>
<p>Now he once even spake to her, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With one another other sisters sleep, but I lie alone,
and alone, maiden, dost thou lie, both being girls unwedded of
like age, both fair, and single both in bed do we sleep.&nbsp;

spring, or winter or the late autumn or the summer; of which dost
thou most desire the coming?&nbsp; Summer, when all are ended,
the toils whereat we labour, or the sweet autumn, when hunger
weighs lightest on men, or even idle winter, for even in winter
many sit warm by the fire, and are lulled in rest and
indolence.&nbsp; Or has beautiful spring more delight for
thee?&nbsp; Say, which does thy heart choose?&nbsp; For our

of God; for sacred are all these things, and all are sweet, yet
for thy sake I will speak out, Cleodamus, and declare what is
sweeter to me than the rest.&nbsp; I would not have summer here,

<span class="GutSmall">THE BOY AND LOVE</span></h3>
<p>A fowler, while yet a boy, was hunting birds in a woodland
glade, and there he saw the winged Love, perched on a box-tree
bough.&nbsp; And when he beheld him, he rejoiced, so big the bird
seemed to him, and he put together all his rods at once, and lay
in wait for Love, that kept hopping, now here, now there.&nbsp;
And the boy, being angered that his toil was endless, cast down
his fowling gear, and went to the old husbandman, that had taught
him his art, and told him all, and showed him Love on his
perch.&nbsp; But the old man, smiling, shook his head, and
answered the lad, &lsquo;Pursue this chase no longer, and go not
after this bird.&nbsp; Nay, flee far from him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
an evil creature.&nbsp; Thou wilt be happy, so long as thou dost
not catch him, but if thou comest to the measure of manhood, this
bird that flees thee now, and hops away, will come uncalled, and
of a sudden, and settle on thy head.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE TUTOR OF LOVE</span></h3>
<p>Great Cypris stood beside me, while still I slumbered, and
with her beautiful hand she led <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the child Love, whose head was
earthward bowed.&nbsp; This word she spake to me, &lsquo;Dear
herdsman, prithee, take Love, and teach him to sing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So said she, and departed, and I&mdash;my store of pastoral song
I taught to Love, in my innocence, as if he had been fain to
learn.&nbsp; I taught him how the cross-flute was invented by
Pan, and the flute by Athene, and by Hermes the tortoise-shell
lyre, and the harp by sweet Apollo.&nbsp; All these things I
taught him as best I might; but he, not heeding my words, himself
would sing me ditties of love, and taught me the desires of
mortals and immortals, and all the deeds of his mother.&nbsp; And
I clean forgot the lore I was teaching to Love, but what Love
taught me, and his love ditties, I learned them all.</p>
<h3>VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LOVE AND THE MUSES</span></h3>
<p>The Muses do not fear the wild Love, but heartily they
cherish, and fleetly follow him.&nbsp; Yea, and if any man sing
that hath a loveless heart, him do they flee, and do not choose
to teach him.&nbsp; But if the mind of any be swayed by Love, and
sweetly he sings, to him the Muses all run eagerly.&nbsp; A
witness hereto am I, that this saying is wholly true, for if I
sing of any other, mortal or immortal, then falters my tongue,
and sings no longer as of old, but if again to Love, and Lycidas
I sing, then gladly from my lips flows forth the voice of
song.</p>

the gods have willed that man enters into life but once (and that
life brief, and too short to hold all we desire), then, wretched
men and weary that we are, how sorely we toil, how greatly we
cast our souls away on gain, and laborious arts, continually
coveting yet more wealth!&nbsp; Surely we have all forgotten that

friend, and as I lead the revel to the shepherd&rsquo;s hut, in
place of the moonlight lend me thine, for to-day the moon began

<p>Mild goddess, in Cyprus born,&mdash;thou child, not of the
sea, but of Zeus,&mdash;why art thou thus vexed with mortals and
immortals?&nbsp; Nay, my <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>word is too weak, why wert thou thus
bitterly wroth, yea, even with thyself, as to bring forth Love,
so mighty a bane to all,&mdash;cruel and heartless Love, whose
spirit is all unlike his beauty?&nbsp; And wherefore didst thou
furnish him with wings, and give him skill to shoot so far, that,
child as he is, we never may escape the bitterness of Love.</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p>Mute was Phoebus in this grievous anguish.&nbsp; All herbs he
sought, and strove to win some wise healing art, and he anointed
all the wound with nectar and ambrosia, but remedeless are all
the wounds of Fate.</p>
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p>But I will go my way to yon sloping hill; by the sand and the
sea-banks murmuring my song, and praying to the cruel
Galatea.&nbsp; But of my sweet hope never will I leave hold, till
I reach the uttermost limit of old age.</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p>It is not well, my friend, to run to the craftsman, whatever
may befall, nor in every matter to need another&rsquo;s aid, nay,
fashion a pipe thyself, and to thee the task is easy.</p>
<h4><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>May Love call to him the Muses, may the Muses bring with them
Love.&nbsp; Ever may the Muses give song to me that yearn for
it,&mdash;sweet song,&mdash;than song there is no sweeter
charm.</p>
<h4>XVII</h4>
<p>The constant dropping of water, says the proverb, it wears a
hole in a stone.</p>
<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p>Nay, leave me not unrewarded, for even Phoebus sang for his
reward.&nbsp; And the meed of honour betters everything.</p>

<p>Beauty is the glory of womankind, and strength of men.</p>

<p>All things, god-willing, all things may be achieved by
mortals.&nbsp; From the hands of the blessed come tasks most
easy, and that find their accomplishment.</p>

for Love, her child,&mdash;&lsquo;Who, where the three ways meet,
has seen Love wandering?&nbsp; He is my runaway, whosoever has
aught to tell of him shall win his reward.&nbsp; His prize is the
kiss of Cypris, but if thou bringest him, not the bare kiss, O
stranger, but yet more shalt thou win.&nbsp; The child is most
notable, thou couldst tell him among twenty together, his skin is
not white, but flame coloured, his eyes are keen and burning, an
evil heart and a sweet tongue has he, for his speech and his mind
are at variance.&nbsp; Like honey is his voice, but his heart of

Acheron, and to the King of Hades.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The body of Love is naked, but well is his spirit

thee the slip; and if he laugh, hale him along.</p>

his kiss, and his lips enchanted.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">EUROPA AND THE BULL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Europa, once on a time, a sweet
dream was sent by Cypris, when the third watch of the night sets
in, and near is the dawning; when sleep more sweet than honey
rests on the eyelids, limb-loosening sleep, that binds the eyes
with his soft bond, when the flock of truthful dreams fares
wandering.</p>
<p>At that hour she was sleeping, beneath the roof-tree of her
home, Europa, the daughter of Phoenix, being still a maid
unwed.&nbsp; Then she beheld two Continents at strife for her
sake, Asia, and the farther shore, both in the shape of
women.&nbsp; Of these one had the guise of a stranger, the other
of a lady of that land, and closer still she clung about her
maiden, and kept saying how &lsquo;she was her mother, and
herself had nursed Europa.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that other with
mighty hands, and forcefully, kept haling the maiden, nothing
loth; declaring that, by the will of &AElig;gis-bearing Zeus,
Europa was destined to be her prize.</p>
<p>But Europa leaped forth from her strown <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>bed in
terror, with beating heart, in such clear vision had she beheld
the dream.&nbsp; Then she sat upon her bed, and long was silent,
still beholding the two women, albeit with waking eyes; and at
last the maiden raised her timorous voice</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who of the gods of heaven has sent forth to me these
phantoms?&nbsp; What manner of dreams have scared me when right
sweetly slumbering on my strown bed, within my bower?&nbsp; Ah,
and who was the alien woman that I beheld in my sleep?&nbsp; How
strange a longing for her seized my heart, yea, and how
graciously she herself did welcome me, and regard me as it had
been her own child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye blessed gods, I pray you, prosper the fulfilment of
the dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therewith she arose, and began to seek the dear maidens of her
company, girls of like age with herself, born in the same year,
beloved of her heart, the daughters of noble sires, with whom she
was always wont to sport, when she was arrayed for the dance, or
when she would bathe her bright body at the mouths of the rivers,
or would gather fragrant lilies on the leas.</p>
<p>And soon she found them, each bearing in her hand a basket to
fill with flowers, and to the meadows near the salt sea they set
forth, where always they were wont to gather in their company,
delighting in the roses, and the sound of the waves.&nbsp; But
Europa herself bore a basket of gold, a marvel well worth gazing
on, a choice work of Hephaestus.&nbsp; He gave it <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>to Libya,
for a bridal-gift, when she approached the bed of the Shaker of
the Earth, and Libya gave it to beautiful Telephassa, who was of
her own blood; and to Europa, still an unwedded maid, her mother,
Telephassa, gave the splendid gift.</p>
<p>Many bright and cunning things were wrought in the basket:
therein was Io, daughter of Inachus, fashioned in gold; still in
the shape of a heifer she was, and had not her woman&rsquo;s
shape, and wildly wandering she fared upon the salt sea-ways,
like one in act to swim; and the sea was wrought in blue
steel.&nbsp; And aloft upon the double brow of the shore, two men
were standing together and watching the heifer&rsquo;s
sea-faring.&nbsp; There too was Zeus, son of Cronos, lightly
touching with his divine hand the cow of the line of Inachus, and
her, by Nile of the seven streams, he was changing again, from a
horned heifer to a woman.&nbsp; Silver was the stream of Nile,
and the heifer of bronze and Zeus himself was fashioned in
gold.&nbsp; And all about, beneath the rim of the rounded basket,
was the story of Hermes graven, and near him lay stretched out
Argus, notable for his sleepless eyes.&nbsp; And from the red
blood of Argus was springing a bird that rejoiced in the
flower-bright colour of his feathers, and spreading abroad his
tail, even as some swift ship on the sea doth spread all canvas,
was covering with his plumes the lips of the golden vessel.&nbsp;
Even thus was wrought the basket of the lovely Europa.</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Now
the girls, so soon as they were come to the flowering meadows,
took great delight in various sorts of flowers, whereof one would
pluck sweet-breathed narcissus, another the hyacinth, another the
violet, a fourth the creeping thyme, and on the ground there fell
many petals of the meadows rich with spring.&nbsp; Others again
were emulously gathering the fragrant tresses of the yellow
crocus; but in the midst of them all the princess culled with her
hand the splendour of the crimson rose, and shone pre-eminent
among them all like the foam-born goddess among the Graces.&nbsp;
Verily she was not for long to set her heart&rsquo;s delight upon
the flowers, nay, nor long to keep untouched her maiden
girdle.&nbsp; For of a truth, the son of Cronos, so soon as he
beheld her, was troubled, and his heart was subdued by the sudden
shafts of Cypris, who alone can conquer even Zeus.&nbsp;
Therefore, both to avoid the wrath of jealous Hera, and being
eager to beguile the maiden&rsquo;s tender heart, he concealed
his godhead, and changed his shape, and became a bull.&nbsp; Not
such an one as feeds in the stall nor such as cleaves the furrow,
and drags the curved plough, nor such as grazes on the grass, nor
such a bull as is subdued beneath the yoke, and draws the
burdened wain.&nbsp; Nay, but while all the rest of his body was
bright chestnut, a silver circle shone between his brows, and his
eyes gleamed softly, and ever sent forth lightning of
desire.&nbsp; From his brow branched horns of even length, like
the crescent of the horned <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>moon, when her disk is cloven in
twain.&nbsp; He came into the meadow, and his coming terrified
not the maidens, nay, within them all wakened desire to draw nigh
the lovely bull, and to touch him, and his heavenly fragrance was
scattered afar, exceeding even the sweet perfume of the
meadows.&nbsp; And he stood before the feet of fair Europa, and
kept licking her neck, and cast his spell over the maiden.&nbsp;
And she still caressed him, and gently with her hands she wiped
away the deep foam from his lips, and kissed the bull.&nbsp; Then
he lowed so gently, ye would think ye heard the Mygdonian flute
uttering a dulcet sound.</p>
<p>He bowed himself before her feet, and, bending back his neck,
he gazed on Europa, and showed her his broad back.&nbsp; Then she
spake among her deep-tressed maidens, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, dear playmates, maidens of like age with me, let
us mount the bull here and take our pastime, for truly, he will
bear us on his back, and carry all of us; and how mild he is, and
dear, and gentle to behold, and no whit like other bulls.&nbsp; A
mind as honest as a man&rsquo;s possesses him, and he lacks
nothing but speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she spake, and smiling, she sat down on the back of the
bull, and the others were about to follow her.&nbsp; But the bull
leaped up immediately, now he had gotten her that he desired, and
swiftly he sped to the deep.&nbsp; The maiden turned, and called
again and again to her dear playmates, stretching out her hands,
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>but they
could not reach her.&nbsp; The strand he gained, and forward he
sped like a dolphin, faring with unwetted hooves over the wide
waves.&nbsp; And the sea, as he came, grew smooth, and the
sea-monsters gambolled around, before the feet of Zeus, and the
dolphin rejoiced, and rising from the deeps, he tumbled on the
swell of the sea.&nbsp; The Nereids arose out of the salt water,
and all of them came on in orderly array, riding on the backs of
sea-beasts.&nbsp; And himself, the thund&rsquo;rous Shaker of the
World, appeared above the sea, and made smooth the wave, and
guided his brother on the salt sea path; and round him were
gathered the Tritons, these hoarse trumpeters of the deep,
blowing from their long conches a bridal melody.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Europa, riding on the back of the divine bull, with
one hand clasped the beast&rsquo;s great horn, and with the other
caught up the purple fold of her garment, lest it might trail and
be wet in the hoar sea&rsquo;s infinite spray.&nbsp; And her deep
robe was swelled out by the winds, like the sail of a ship, and
lightly still did waft the maiden onward.&nbsp; But when she was
now far off from her own country, and neither sea-beat headland
nor steep hill could now be seen, but above, the air, and
beneath, the limitless deep, timidly she looked around, and
uttered her voice, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whither bearest thou me, bull-god?&nbsp; What art thou?
how dost thou fare on thy feet through the path of the
sea-beasts, nor fearest <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the sea?&nbsp; The sea is a path
meet for swift ships that traverse the brine, but bulls dread the
salt sea-ways.&nbsp; What drink is sweet to thee, what food shalt
thou find from the deep?&nbsp; Nay, art thou then some god, for
godlike are these deeds of thine?&nbsp; Lo, neither do dolphins
of the brine fare on land, nor bulls on the deep, but dreadless
dost thou rush o&rsquo;er land and sea alike, thy hooves serving
thee for oars.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, perchance thou wilt rise above the grey air, and
flee on high, like the swift birds.&nbsp; Alas for me, and alas
again, for mine exceeding evil fortune, alas for me that have
left my father&rsquo;s house, and following this bull, on a
strange sea-faring I go, and wander lonely.&nbsp; But I pray thee
that rulest the grey salt sea, thou Shaker of the Earth,
propitious meet me, and methinks I see thee smoothing this path
of mine before me.&nbsp; For surely it is not without a god to
aid, that I pass through these paths of the waters!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and the horned bull made answer to her
again&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take courage, maiden, and dread not the swell of the
deep.&nbsp; Behold I am Zeus, even I, though, closely beheld, I
wear the form of a bull, for I can put on the semblance of what
thing I will.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis love of thee that has
compelled me to measure out so great a space of the salt sea, in
a bull&rsquo;s shape.&nbsp; Lo, Crete shall presently receive
thee, Crete that was mine own foster-mother, where thy bridal
chamber shall be.&nbsp; Yea, and from me shalt <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>thou bear
glorious sons, to be sceptre-swaying kings over earthly men.</p>
<p>So spake he, and all he spake was fulfilled.&nbsp; And verily
Crete appeared, and Zeus took his own shape again, and he loosed
her girdle, and the Hours arrayed their bridal bed.&nbsp; She
that before was a maiden straightway became the bride of Zeus,
and she bare children to Zeus, yea, anon she was a mother.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE LAMENT FOR BION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Wail</span>, let me hear you wail, ye
woodland glades, and thou Dorian water; and weep ye rivers, for
Bion, the well beloved!&nbsp; Now all ye green things mourn, and
now ye groves lament him, ye flowers now in sad clusters breathe
yourselves away.&nbsp; Now redden ye roses in your sorrow, and
now wax red ye wind-flowers, now thou hyacinth, whisper the
letters on thee graven, and add a deeper <i>ai ai</i> to thy
petals; he is dead, the beautiful singer.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Ye nightingales that lament among the thick leaves of the
trees, tell ye to the Sicilian waters of Arethusa the tidings
that Bion the herdsman is dead, and that with Bion song too has
died, and perished hath the Dorian minstrelsy.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Ye Strymonian swans, sadly wail ye by the waters, and chant
with melancholy notes the dolorous song, even such a song as in
his time <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>with voice like yours he was wont to sing.&nbsp; And
tell again to the &OElig;agrian maidens, tell to all the Nymphs
Bistonian, how that he hath perished, the Dorian Orpheus.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>No more to his herds he sings, that beloved herdsman, no more
&rsquo;neath the lonely oaks he sits and sings, nay, but by
Pluteus&rsquo;s side he chants a refrain of oblivion.&nbsp; The
mountains too are voiceless: and the heifers that wander by the
bulls lament and refuse their pasture.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Thy sudden doom, O Bion, Apollo himself lamented, and the
Satyrs mourned thee, and the Priapi in sable raiment, and the
Panes sorrow for thy song, and the fountain fairies in the wood
made moan, and their tears turned to rivers of waters.&nbsp; And
Echo in the rocks laments that thou art silent, and no more she
mimics thy voice.&nbsp; And in sorrow for thy fall the trees cast
down their fruit, and all the flowers have faded.&nbsp; From the
ewes hath flowed no fair milk, nor honey from the hives, nay, it
hath perished for mere sorrow in the wax, for now hath thy honey
perished, and no more it behoves men to gather the honey of the
bees.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Not so much did the dolphin mourn beside the sea-banks, nor
ever sang so sweet the nightingale on the cliffs, nor so much
lamented <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

shrilled so loud the halcyon o&rsquo;er his sorrows;</p>
<p>(<i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the

<p>Nor so much, by the grey sea-waves, did ever the sea-bird
sing, nor so much in the dells of dawn did the bird of Memnon
bewail the son of the Morning, fluttering around his tomb, as
they lamented for Bion dead.</p>
<p>Nightingales, and all the swallows that once he was wont to
delight, that he would teach to speak, they sat over against each
other on the boughs and kept moaning, and the birds sang in
answer, &lsquo;Wail, ye wretched ones, even ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Who, ah who will ever make music on thy pipe, O thrice desired
Bion, and who will put his mouth to the reeds of thine
instrument? who is so bold?</p>
<p>For still thy lips and still thy breath survive, and Echo,
among the reeds, doth still feed upon thy songs.&nbsp; To Pan
shall I bear the pipe?&nbsp; Nay, perchance even he would fear to
set his mouth to it, lest, after thee, he should win but the
second prize.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Yea, and Galatea laments thy song, she whom once thou wouldst
delight, as with thee she sat by the sea-banks.&nbsp; For not
like the Cyclops didst thou sing&mdash;him fair Galatea ever
fled, but on thee she still looked more kindly <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>than on the
salt water.&nbsp; And now hath she forgotten the wave, and sits
on the lonely sands, but still she keeps thy kine.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>All the gifts of the Muses, herdsman, have died with thee, the
delightful kisses of maidens, the lips of boys; and woful round
thy tomb the loves are weeping.&nbsp; But Cypris loves thee far
more than the kiss wherewith she kissed the dying Adonis.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>This, O most musical of rivers, is thy second sorrow, this,
Meles, thy new woe.&nbsp; Of old didst thou lose Homer, that
sweet mouth of Calliope, and men say thou didst bewail thy goodly
son with streams of many tears, and didst fill all the salt sea
with the voice of thy lamentation&mdash;now again another son
thou weepest, and in a new sorrow art thou wasting away.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Both were beloved of the fountains, and one ever drank of the
Pegasean fount, but the other would drain a draught of
Arethusa.&nbsp; And the one sang the fair daughter of Tyndarus,
and the mighty son of Thetis, and Menelaus Atreus&rsquo;s son,
but that other,&mdash;not of wars, not of tears, but of Pan,
would he sing, and of herdsmen would he chant, and so singing, he
tended the herds.&nbsp; And pipes he would fashion, and would
milk the sweet heifer, and taught lads <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>how to
kiss, and Love he cherished in his bosom and woke the passion of
Aphrodite.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Every famous city laments thee, Bion, and all the towns.&nbsp;
Ascra laments thee far more than her Hesiod, and Pindar is less
regretted by the forests of Boeotia.&nbsp; Nor so much did
pleasant Lesbos mourn for Alcaeus, nor did the Teian town so
greatly bewail her poet, while for thee more than for Archilochus
doth Paros yearn, and not for Sappho, but still for thee doth
Mytilene wail her musical lament;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Here seven verses are
lost</i>.]</p>
<p>And in Syracuse Theocritus; but I sing thee the dirge of an
Ausonian sorrow, I that am no stranger to the pastoral song, but
heir of the Doric Muse which thou didst teach thy pupils.&nbsp;
This was thy gift to me; to others didst thou leave thy wealth,
to me thy minstrelsy.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Ah me, when the mallows wither in the garden, and the green
parsley, and the curled tendrils of the anise, on a later day
they live again, and spring in another year; but we men, we, the
great and mighty, or wise, when once we have died, in hollow
earth we sleep, gone down into silence; a right long, and
endless, and unawakening sleep.&nbsp; And thou too, in the earth
wilt be lapped in silence, but the nymphs have thought good that
the frog should eternally <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>sing.&nbsp; Nay, him I would not
envy, for &rsquo;tis no sweet song he singeth.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>Poison came, Bion, to thy mouth, thou didst know poison.&nbsp;
To such lips as thine did it come, and was not sweetened?&nbsp;
What mortal was so cruel that could mix poison for thee, or who
could give thee the venom that heard thy voice? surely he had no
music in his soul.</p>
<p><i>Begin</i>, <i>ye Sicilian Muses</i>, <i>begin the
dirge</i>.</p>
<p>But justice hath overtaken them all.&nbsp; Still for this
sorrow I weep, and bewail thy ruin.&nbsp; But ah, if I might have
gone down like Orpheus to Tartarus, or as once Odysseus, or
Alcides of yore, I too would speedily have come to the house of
Pluteus, that thee perchance I might behold, and if thou singest
to Pluteus, that I might hear what is thy song.&nbsp; Nay, sing
to the Maiden some strain of Sicily, sing some sweet pastoral
lay.</p>
<p>And she too is Sicilian, and on the shores by Aetna she was
wont to play, and she knew the Dorian strain.&nbsp; Not
unrewarded will the singing be; and as once to Orpheus&rsquo;s
sweet minstrelsy she gave Eurydice to return with him, even so
will she send thee too, Bion, to the hills.&nbsp; But if I, even
I, and my piping had aught availed, before Pluteus I too would
have sung.</p>

for he hath many labours at his hand, whereat he laboureth <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>in
wanderings by land and sea, with his soul strong as rock or steel
within his breast.&nbsp; But thy grief is as the running waters,
as thou lamentest through the nights and all the days of
Zeus.</p>
<p>Nor is there any one of my kinsfolk nigh at hand to cheer me:
for it is not the house wall that severs them, but they all dwell
far beyond the pine-clad Isthmus, nor is there any to whom, as a
woman all hapless, I may look up and refresh my heart, save only
my sister Pyrrha; nay, but she herself grieves yet more for her
husband Iphicles thy son: for methinks &rsquo;tis thou that hast
borne the most luckless children of all, to a God, and a mortal
man. <a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205"
class="citation">[205]</a></p>
<p>Thus spake she, and ever warmer the tears were pouring from
her eyes into her sweet bosom, as she bethought her of her
children and next of her own parents.&nbsp; And in like manner
Alcmena bedewed her pale cheeks with tears, and deeply sighing
from her very heart she thus bespoke her dear daughter with
thick-coming words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear child, what is this that hath come into the
thoughts of thy heart?&nbsp; How art thou fain to disquiet us
both with the tale of griefs that cannot be forgotten?&nbsp; Not
for the first time are these woes wept for now.&nbsp; Are they
not enough, the woes that possess us from our birth continually
to our day of death?&nbsp; In love with sorrow surely would he be
that should <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>have the heart to count up our woes; such destiny have
we received from God.&nbsp; Thyself, dear child, I behold vext by
endless pains, and thy grief I can pardon, yea, for even of joy
there is satiety.&nbsp; And exceedingly do I mourn over and pity
thee, for that thou hast partaken of our cruel lot, the burden
whereof is hung above our heads.&nbsp; For so witness Persephone
and fair-robed Demeter (by whom the enemy that wilfully forswears
himself, lies to his own hurt), that I love thee no less in my
heart than if thou hadst been born of my womb, and wert the
maiden darling of my house: nay, and methinks that thou knowest
this well.&nbsp; Therefore say never, my flower, that I heed thee
not, not even though I wail more ceaselessly than Niobe of the
lovely locks.&nbsp; No shame it is for a mother to make moan for
the affliction of her son: for ten months I went heavily, even
before I saw him, while I bare him under my girdle, and he
brought me near the gates of the warden of Hell; so fierce the
pangs I endured in my sore travail of him.&nbsp; And now my son
is gone from me in a strange land to accomplish some new labour;
nor know I in my sorrow whether I shall again receive him
returning here or no.&nbsp; Moreover in sweet sleep a dreadful
dream hath fluttered me; and I exceedingly fear for the
ill-omened vision that I have seen, lest something that I would
not be coming on my children.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that my son, the might of Heracles, held in
both hands a well-wrought <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>spade, wherewith, as one labouring
for hire, he was digging a ditch at the edge of a fruitful field,
stripped of his cloak and belted tunic.&nbsp; And when he had
come to the end of all his work and his labours at the stout
defence of the vine-filled close, he was about to lean his shovel
against the upstanding mound and don the clothes he had
worn.&nbsp; But suddenly blazed up above the deep trench a
quenchless fire, and a marvellous great flame encompassed
him.&nbsp; But he kept ever giving back with hurried feet,
striving to flee the deadly bolt of Hephaestus; and ever before
his body he kept his spade as it were a shield; and this way and
that he glared around him with his eyes, lest the angry fire
should consume him.&nbsp; Then brave Iphicles, eager, methought,
to help him, stumbled and fell to earth ere he might reach him,
nor could he stand upright again, but lay helpless, like a weak
old man, whom joyless age constrains to fall when he would not;
so he lieth on the ground as he fell, till one passing by lift
him up by the hand, regarding the ancient reverence for his hoary
beard.&nbsp; Thus lay on the earth Iphicles, wielder of the
shield.&nbsp; But I kept wailing as I beheld my sons in their
sore plight, until deep sleep quite fled from my eyes, and
straightway came bright morn.&nbsp; Such dreams, beloved, flitted
through my mind all night; may they all turn against Eurystheus
nor come nigh our dwelling, and to his hurt be my soul prophetic,
nor may fate bring aught otherwise to pass.</p>

&epsilon;&chi;&#940;&lambda;&alpha;&xi;&alpha;.&nbsp; Asphalion
first hooked his fish, which ran gamely, and nearly doubled up
the rod.&nbsp; Then the fish sulked, and the angler half
despaired of landing him.&nbsp; To stir the sullen fish, he
reminded him of his wound, probably, as we do now, by keeping a
tight line, and tapping the butt of the rod.&nbsp; Then he
slackened, giving the fish line in case of a sudden rush; but as
there was no such rush, he took in line, or perhaps only showed
his fish the butt (for it is not probable that Asphalion had a
reel), and so landed him.&nbsp; The Mediterranean fishers
generally toss the fish to land with no display of science, but
Asphalion&rsquo;s imaginary capture was a monster.</p>
<p><a name="footnote108b"></a><a href="#citation108b"
class="footnote">[108b]</a>&nbsp; It is difficult to understand
this proceeding.&nbsp; Perhaps Asphalion had some small net
fastened with strings to his boat, in which he towed fish to
shore, that the contact with the water might keep them fresher
than they were likely to be in the bottom of the coble.&nbsp; On
the other hand, Asphalion was fishing from a rock.&nbsp; His
dream may have been confused.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
